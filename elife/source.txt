To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated <i>Rab23-</i>deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyndactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in <i>Rab23<sup>-/-</sup></i>sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2.The calvarial suture allows us to study many developmental processes that regulate osteogenesis and skull morphogenesis. Normal development is ensured by the correct temporal and spatial coordination of skeletal patterning, mesenchymal stem cell niche regulation, condensation formation, osteoprogenitor expansion, and osteoblast differentiation and function. In this study, we generated <i>Rab23-</i>deficient mice that survive into late gestation and they exhibit multiple suture craniosynostosis. We show that RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, represses Hh, and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion. RAB23 also represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling which has the multiple effect of directly regulating osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation and of repressing GLI1. Therefore, RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity, as well as the activation of GLI1. In an attempt to study complex developmental events, we have utilized both primary cells and organ culture approaches. However, one can also take a more cell biological approach using immortalized cells remote from the external factors and by using this standardized approach it may be easier to understand the effects of a specific intervention. This will be help deciphering the role of RAB23, specifically during endocytosis.
<NbChars_0.7><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Conjugative transfer of the integrative and conjugative element ICE<i>clc</i> in <i>Pseudomonas</i> requires development of a transfer competence state in stationary phase, which arises only in 3–5% of individual cells. The mechanisms controlling this bistable switch between non-active and transfer competent cells have long remained enigmatic. Using a variety of genetic tools and epistasis experiments in <i>P. putida</i>, we uncovered an ‘upstream’ cascade of three consecutive transcription factor-nodes, which controls transfer competence initiation. One of the uncovered transcription factors (named BisR) is representative for a new regulator family. Initiation activates a feedback loop, controlled by a second hitherto unrecognized heteromeric transcription factor named BisDC. Stochastic modelling and experimental data demonstrated the feedback loop to act as a scalable converter of unimodal (population-wide or ‘analog’) input to bistable (subpopulation-specific or ‘digital’) output. The feedback loop further enables prolonged production of BisDC, which ensures expression of the ‘downstream’ functions mediating ICE transfer competence in activated cells. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the ICE<i>clc</i> regulatory constellation with BisR and BisDC is widespread among <i>Gamma-</i> and <i>Beta</i>-proteobacteria, including various pathogenic strains, highlighting its evolutionary conservation and prime importance to control the behaviour of this wide family of conjugative elements.ICEs operate a dual life style in their host, which controls their overall fitness as the integral of vertical descent (i.e., maintenance of the integrated state and replication with the host chromosome) and horizontal transfer (i.e., excision from the host cell, transfer and reintegration into a new host) (<a href="#bib14">Delavat et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib13">Delavat et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib28">Johnson and Grossman, 2015</a>). The decision for horizontal transfer is costly and potentially damages the host cell (<a href="#bib13">Delavat et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib51">Pradervand et al., 2014</a>), which is probably why its frequency of occurrence in most ICEs is fairly low (&lt;10<sup>–5</sup> per cell in a host cell population) (<a href="#bib14">Delavat et al., 2017</a>). Consequently, the mechanisms that initiate and ensure ICE horizontal transfer must have been selected to operate under extremely low opportunity with high success. In other words, they have been selected to maximize faithful maintenance of transfer competence development, once this process has been triggered in a host cell. One would thus expect such mechanisms to impinge on rare, perhaps stochastic cellular events, yielding robust output despite cellular gene expression and pathway noise. ICE<i>clc</i> is further particular in the sense that its transfer competence is initiated in cells during stationary phase conditions (<a href="#bib43">Miyazaki et al., 2012</a>), which restricts global transcription and activity, and may even profoundly alter the cytoplasmic state of the cell (<a href="#bib47">Parry et al., 2014</a>).
<NbChars_1.6><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence of clinical efficacy. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 µmol/L (95% credible interval 10.1–17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarization is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration &gt;150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality in chloroquine self-poisoning. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that most high dose regimens trialled in COVID-19 are unlikely to cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.Chloroquine is dangerous in overdose. The risk of death is proportional to drug exposure. Mortality rises steeply at whole blood chloroquine concentrations above 10 µmol/L. This corresponds very approximately to a plasma concentration of 3 µmol/L, and a combined chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentration (as in a spectrophotometric assay) of 14 µmol/L. Importantly the electrocardiograph is a valuable indicator of toxicity as potentially lethal levels are associated with significant QRS complex widening. A QRS duration of less than 100 msec makes lethal toxicity very unlikely. When using high-dose treatments weight adjusted dosing is important to avoid toxicity.
<NbChars_0.9><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Hippocampal firing is organized in theta sequences controlled by internal memory processes and by external sensory cues, but how these computations are coordinated is not fully understood. Although theta activity is commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation, it is the result of complex interactions between different rhythm generators. Here, by separating hippocampal theta activity in three different current generators, we found epochs with variable theta frequency and phase coupling, suggesting flexible interactions between theta generators. We found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurred during behavioral tasks requiring coordination between internal memory representations and incoming sensory information. In addition, we found that gamma oscillations were associated with specific theta generators and the strength of theta-gamma coupling predicted the synchronization between theta generators. We propose a mechanism for segregating or integrating hippocampal computations based on the flexible coordination of different theta frameworks to accommodate the cognitive needs.Overall, our results provide functional evidence supporting independent theta oscillations in the hippocampus whose coordination can be seen as a mechanism to channel information between hippocampal layers. Synchronized theta states may bind distributed computations, while less synchronized theta states may secure relatively independent processing in local circuits (segregation). What might be the mechanism coordinating theta frameworks? We show that theta phase locking across hippocampal layers is associated with stronger CFC. Furthermore, directionality analysis demonstrates that band- and pathway-specific gamma activity consistently precede theta waves, possibly contributing to the synchronization of theta oscillations across layers. We thus hypothesize that the CFC reflects a mechanism operated by local excitation-inhibition interactions to coordinate neuronal computations in separated theta frameworks. In a network with multiple connected nodes, theta-phase locking between specific nodes would further contribute to the directionality of the information flow, habilitating targets between which communication is permitted or prevented in defined time windows. We have provided evidence supporting this hypothesis by showing that CFC and the coordination between the theta current generators recorded in the hippocampus increase in the mnemonic process.
<NbChars_1.1><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Current models successfully describe the auditory cortical response to natural sounds with a set of spectro-temporal features. However, these models have hardly been linked to the ill-understood neurobiological changes that occur in the aging auditory cortex. Modelling the hemodynamic response to a rich natural sound mixture in N = 64 listeners of varying age, we here show that in older listeners’ auditory cortex, the key feature of temporal rate is represented with a markedly broader tuning. This loss of temporal selectivity is most prominent in primary auditory cortex and planum temporale, with no such changes in adjacent auditory or other brain areas. Amongst older listeners, we observe a direct relationship between chronological age and temporal-rate tuning, unconfounded by auditory acuity or model goodness of fit. In line with senescent neural dedifferentiation more generally, our results highlight decreased selectivity to temporal information as a hallmark of the aging auditory cortex.This cross-sectional approach used encoding and decoding models of hemodynamic responses to compare the spectro-temporal fidelity in auditory cortex of younger and older listeners. We pursued the long-standing but largely understudied question whether temporal and/or spectral modulations, which are key acoustic dimensions of behaviourally relevant signals such as speech and music, are represented in a less differentiated fashion in the aging auditory cortex.
<NbChars_1.7><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Although many high-risk mucosal and cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPVs) theoretically have the potential to synthesize L1 isoforms differing in length, previous seroepidemiological studies only focused on the short L1 variants, co-assembling with L2 to infectious virions. Using the multimammate mouse <i>Mastomys coucha</i> as preclinical model, this is the first study demonstrating seroconversion against different L1 isoforms during the natural course of papillomavirus infection. Intriguingly, positivity with the cutaneous MnPV was accompanied by a strong seroresponse against a longer L1 isoform, but to our surprise, the raised antibodies were non-neutralizing. Only after a delay of around 4 months, protecting antibodies against the short L1 appeared, enabling the virus to successfully establish an infection. This argues for a novel humoral immune escape mechanism that may also have important implications on the interpretation of epidemiological data in terms of seropositivity and protection of PV infections in general.The non-random distribution of several ATG initiation codons within the L1 open reading frame (ORF) of certain human and animal papillomaviruses (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) potentially allows the translation of different L1 isoforms. Despite plenty of seroepidemiological studies on HPV, to our knowledge, seroresponses against different L1 isoforms have never been performed. Previous studies only focused on the shortest variant, known to efficiently form virus-like particles (VLPs) or, together with L2, infectious virions (<a href="#bib7">Buck et al., 2005b</a>).
<NbChars_1.2><LevSim_0.5><Discussion>Tumors are composed of many different cell types including cancer cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Dissecting functional metabolic differences between cell types within a mixed population can be challenging due to the rapid turnover of metabolites relative to the time needed to isolate cells. To overcome this challenge, we traced isotope-labeled nutrients into macromolecules that turn over more slowly than metabolites. This approach was used to assess differences between cancer cell and fibroblast metabolism in murine pancreatic cancer organoid-fibroblast co-cultures and tumors. Pancreatic cancer cells exhibited increased pyruvate carboxylation relative to fibroblasts, and this flux depended on both pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme 1 activity. Consequently, expression of both enzymes in cancer cells was necessary for organoid and tumor growth, demonstrating that dissecting the metabolism of specific cell populations within heterogeneous systems can identify dependencies that may not be evident from studying isolated cells in culture or bulk tissue.Metabolism can differ between cancer cells in culture and tumors, and understanding how nutrients are used by cancer cells in vivo has been an area of interest for developing cancer therapies. Tumor metabolic phenotypes have been assumed to reflect the metabolism of cancer cells within a tumor; however, in many tumors such as in PDAC, cancer cells are a minority cell population. Metabolic interactions between cell types have been described in normal tissues (<a href="#bib7">Bélanger et al., 2011</a>), and some metabolic phenotypes observed in cancer cells such as increased glucose utilization are also prominent in other cell types including fibroblasts and immune cells that can be abundant in some tumors (<a href="#bib47">Lemons et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib89">Vincent et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib97">Zhao et al., 2019</a>). Therefore, methods to deconvolute which cell types in a tumor are responsible for observed tissue metabolic phenotypes are needed.
<NbChars_1.0><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Understanding the consequences of ongoing biodiversity changes for ecosystems is a pressing challenge. Controlled biodiversity-ecosystem function experiments with random biodiversity loss scenarios have demonstrated that more diverse communities usually provide higher levels of ecosystem functioning. However, it is not clear if these results predict the ecosystem consequences of environmental changes that cause non-random alterations in biodiversity and community composition. We synthesized 69 independent studies reporting 660 observations of the impacts of two pervasive drivers of global change (chemical stressors and nutrient enrichment) on animal and microbial decomposer diversity and litter decomposition. Using meta-analysis and structural equation modeling, we show that declines in decomposer diversity and abundance explain reduced litter decomposition in response to stressors but not to nutrients. While chemical stressors generally reduced biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, detrimental effects of nutrients occurred only at high levels of nutrient inputs. Thus, more intense environmental change does not always result in stronger responses, illustrating the complexity of ecosystem consequences of biodiversity change. Overall, these findings provide strong evidence that the consequences of observed biodiversity change for ecosystems depend on the kind of environmental change, and are especially significant when human activities decrease biodiversity.The present synthesis brings new insights into how changes in decomposer biodiversity induced by two pervasive drivers of environmental change ultimately affect decomposition. We find concomitant changes in biodiversity and decomposition under the influence of chemical stressors but not nutrient enrichment, highlighting that real-world patterns relating shifts in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning depend on the type of environmental change. In fact, we observed significant correlations between effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function in a scenario where chemical stressors caused a significant decline in biodiversity. In contrast, in cases where nutrient enrichment caused variable responses in biodiversity, relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function responses were weaker. It remains an understudied but important question if results of controlled BEF experiments are applicable to non-random changes in biodiversity caused by human activities (e.g. <a href="#bib32">De Laender et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib43">Duffy et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib50">Eisenhauer et al., 2019b</a>; <a href="#bib139">Srivastava and Vellend, 2005</a>; <a href="#bib147">van der Plas, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib154">Wardle, 2016</a>). The present results provide strong empirical evidence for significant real-world BEF relationships when environmental changes decrease biodiversity.
<NbChars_0.6><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Multivalent presentation of viral glycoproteins can substantially increase the elicitation of antigen-specific antibodies. To enable a new generation of anti-viral vaccines, we designed self-assembling protein nanoparticles with geometries tailored to present the ectodomains of influenza, HIV, and RSV viral glycoprotein trimers. We first <i>de novo</i> designed trimers tailored for antigen fusion, featuring N-terminal helices positioned to match the C termini of the viral glycoproteins. Trimers that experimentally adopted their designed configurations were incorporated as components of tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed for their ability to present viral glycoproteins. Electron microscopy and antibody binding experiments demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles presented antigenically intact prefusion HIV-1 Env, influenza hemagglutinin, and RSV F trimers in the predicted geometries. This work demonstrates that antigen-displaying protein nanoparticles can be designed from scratch, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on the immune response to vaccination.Strong BCR signaling is required for eliciting robust humoral immune responses, but the molecular mechanisms by which this can be accomplished are not fully understood. Historically, live-attenuated or inactivated viruses and engineered virus-like particles (VLPs) have been able to confer protective immunity without pathogenicity, but the empirical discovery and compositional complexity of such vaccines has hampered understanding of possible mechanisms for obtaining sufficient levels of protective antibodies. <i>De novo</i> designed protein nanoparticles provide a modular way to present antigens to the immune system in defined geometries and of known composition. Multivalent antigen presentation can enhance antigen-specific antibody titers by orders of magnitude (<a href="#bib7">Bennett et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib61">Snapper, 2018</a>), but presentation of complex antigens is challenging due to the required geometric compatibility between antigen and scaffold. The design approach described here, in which nanoparticles incorporate <i>de novo</i> designed homo-oligomers tailored to present antigens of interest, is a general solution to this problem. More broadly, the ability to build protein-based nanomaterials with geometric specifications from scratch represents an important step forward in computational protein design, and provides a systematic way to investigate the influence of antigen presentation geometry on immune response.
<NbChars_1.5><LevSim_0.4><Discussion>Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.In this work we set out to better understand how intrinsic E:I imbalance affects the autistic brain in a sex-specific manner. Evidence from animal models of rare genetic variants associated with autism have typically been used as the primary evidence for the E:I imbalance theory (<a href="#bib86">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</a>; <a href="#bib95">Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019</a>). However, these variants affect only a small percentage of the autism population. Thus, it is unclear how E:I imbalance might affect the majority of heterogeneous individuals within the total autism population. To bridge this gap we need multi-level methods that can be applied to understand the ‘living biology’ behind actual human individuals (<a href="#bib22">Courchesne et al., 2019</a>), such as in vivo neuroimaging data and metrics applied to such time-series data that are linked to actual underlying neural E:I mechanisms (<a href="#bib67">Markicevic et al., 2020</a>). Bridging this gap will help us identify mechanistic targets that explain neural and behavioral variability across a much larger portion of individuals in the autism population.
