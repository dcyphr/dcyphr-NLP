<NbChars_0.3><LevSim_0.4>Abstract|Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale1,2,3. Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.
<NbChars_0.1><LevSim_0.2>Conclusions and future perspectives|The resource reported in this paper and its companion papers has yielded insights into the nature and timing of the many mutational processes that shape large- and small-scale somatic variation in the cancer genome; the patterns of selection that act on these variations; the widespread effect of somatic variants on transcription; the complementary roles of the coding and non-coding genome for both germline and somatic mutations; the ubiquity of intratumoral heterogeneity; and the distinctive evolutionary trajectory of each cancer type. Many of these insights can be obtained only from an integrated analysis of all classes of somatic mutation on a whole-genome scale, and would not be accessible with, for example, targeted exome sequencing.The promise of precision medicine is to match patients to targeted therapies using genomics. A major barrier to its evidence-based implementation is the daunting heterogeneity of cancer chronicled in these papers, from tumour type to tumour type, from patient to patient, from clone to clone and from cell to cell. Building meaningful clinical predictors from genomic data can be achieved, but will require knowledge banks comprising tens of thousands of patients with comprehensive clinical characterization83. As these sample sizes will be too large for any single funding agency, pharmaceutical company or health system, international collaboration and data sharing will be required. The next phase of ICGC, ICGC-ARGO (https://www.icgc-argo.org/), will bring the cancer genomics community together with healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, data science and clinical trials groups to build comprehensive knowledge banks of clinical outcome and treatment data from patients with a wide variety of cancers, matched with detailed molecular profiling.Extending the story begun by TCGA, ICGC and other cancer genomics projects, the PCAWG has brought us closer to a comprehensive narrative of the causal biological changes that drive cancer phenotypes. We must now translate this knowledge into sustainable, meaningful clinical treatments.
<NbChars_0.1><LevSim_0.1>Methods|SamplesWe compiled an inventory of matched tumour–normal whole-cancer genomes in the ICGC Data Coordinating Centre. Most samples came from treatment-naive, primary cancers, although a small number of donors had multiple samples of primary, metastatic and/or recurrent tumours. Our inclusion criteria were: (1) matched tumour and normal specimen pair; (2) a minimal set of clinical fields; and (3) characterization of tumour and normal whole genomes using Illumina HiSeq paired-end sequencing reads.We collected genome data from 2,834 donors, representing all ICGC and TCGA donors that met these criteria at the time of the final data freeze in autumn 2014 (Extended Data Table 1). After quality assurance (Supplementary Methods 2.5), data from 176 donors were excluded as unusable, 75 had minor issues that could affect some analyses (grey-listed donors) and 2,583 had data of optimal quality (white-listed donors)(Supplementary Table 1). Across the 2,658 white- and grey-listed donors, whole-genome sequences were available from 2,605 primary tumours and 173 metastases or local recurrences. Matching normal samples were obtained from blood (2,064 donors), tissue adjacent to the primary tumour (87 donors) or from distant sites (507 donors). Whole-genome sequencing data were available for tumour and normal DNA for the entire cohort. The mean read coverage was 39× for normal samples, whereas tumours had a bimodal coverage distribution with modes at 38× and 60× (Supplementary Fig. 1). The majority of specimens (65.3%) were sequenced using 101-bp paired-end reads. An additional 28% were sequenced with 100-bp paired-end reads. Of the remaining specimens, 4.7% were sequenced with read lengths longer than 101 bp, and 1.9% with read lengths shorter than 100 bp. The distribution of read lengths by tumour cohort is shown in Supplementary Fig. 11. Median read length for whole-genome sequencing paired-end reads was 101 bp (mean = 106.2, s.d. = 16.7; minimum–maximum = 50–151). RNA-sequencing data were collected and re-analysed centrally for 1,222 donors, including 1,178 primary tumours, 67 metastases or local recurrences and 153 matched normal tissue samples adjacent to the primary tumour.Demographically, the cohort included 1,469 men (55%) and 1,189 women (45%), with a mean age of 56 years (range, 1–90 years) (Supplementary Table 1). Using population ancestry-differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms, the ancestry distribution was heavily weighted towards donors of European descent (77% of total) followed by East Asians (16%), as expected for large contributions from European, North American and Australian projects (Supplementary Table 1).We consolidated histopathology descriptions of the tumour samples, using the ICD-0-3 tumour site controlled vocabulary89. Overall, the PCAWG dataset comprises 38 distinct tumour types (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Although the most common tumour types are included in the dataset, their distribution does not match the relative population incidences, largely owing to differences among contributing ICGC/TCGA groups in the numbers of sequenced samples.Uniform processing and somatic variant callingTo generate a consistent set of somatic mutation calls that could be used for cross-tumour analyses, we analysed all 6,835 samples using a uniform set of algorithms for alignment, variant calling and quality control (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Methods 2). We used the BWA-MEM algorithm90 to align each tumour and normal sample to human reference build hs37d5 (as used in the 1000 Genomes Project91). Somatic mutations were identified in the aligned data using three established pipelines, which were run independently on each tumour–normal pair. Each of the three pipelines—labelled ‘Sanger’92,93,94,95, ‘EMBL/DKFZ’96,97 and ‘Broad’98,99,100,101 after the computational biology groups that created or assembled them—consisted of multiple software packages for calling somatic SNVs, small indels, CNAs and somatic SVs (with intrachromosomal SVs defined as those >100 bp). Two additional variant algorithms102,103 were included to further improve accuracy across a broad range of clonal and subclonal mutations. We tested different merging strategies using validation data, and choses the optimal method for each variant type to generate a final consensus set of mutation calls (Supplementary Methods S2.4).Somatic retrotransposition events, including Alu and LINE-1 insertions72, L1-mediated transductions73 and pseudogene formation104, were called using a dedicated pipeline73. We removed these retrotransposition events from the somatic SV call-set. Mitochondrial DNA mutations were called using a published algorithm105. RNA-sequencing data were uniformly processed to quantify normalized gene-level expression, splicing variation and allele-specific expression, and to identify fusion transcripts, alternative promoter usage and sites of RNA editing8.Integration, phasing and validation of germline variant call-setsCalls of common (≥1% frequency in PCAWG) and rare (<1%) germline variants including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, indels, SVs and mobile-element insertions (MEIs) were generated using a population-scale genetic polymorphism-detection approach91,106. The uniform germline data-processing workflow comprised variant identification using six different variant-calling algorithms96,107,108 and was orchestrated using the Butler workflow system109.We performed call-set benchmarking, merging, variant genotyping and statistical haplotype-block phasing91 (Supplementary Methods 3.4). Using this strategy, we identified 80.1 million germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 5.9 million germline indels, 1.8 million multi-allelic short (<50 bp) germline variants, as well as germline SVs ≥ 50 bp in size including 29,492 biallelic deletions and 27,254 MEIs (Supplementary Table 2). We statistically phased this germline variant set using haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project91 as a reference panel, yielding an N50-phased block length of 265 kb based on haploid chromosomes from donor-matched tumour genomes. Precision estimates for germline SNVs and indels were >99% for the phased merged call-set, and sensitivity estimates ranged from 92% to 98%.Core alignment and variant calling by cloud computingThe requirement to uniformly realign and call variants on nearly 5,800 whole genomes (tumour plus normal) presented considerable computational challenges, and raised ethical issues owing to the use of data from different jurisdictions (Extended Data Table 2). To process the data, we adopted a cloud-computing architecture26 in which the alignment and variant calling was spread across 13 data centres on 3 continents, representing a mixture of commercial, infrastructure-as-a-service, academic cloud compute and traditional academic high-performance computer clusters (Supplementary Table 3). Together, the effort used 10 million CPU-core hours.To generate reproducible variant calling across the 13 data centres, we built the core pipelines into Docker containers28, in which the workflow description, required code and all associated dependencies were packaged together in stand-alone packages. These heavily tested, extensively validated workflows are available for download (Box 1).Validation, benchmarking and merging of somatic variant callsTo evaluate the performance of each of the mutation-calling pipelines and determine an integration strategy, we performed a large-scale deep-sequencing validation experiment (Supplementary Notes 1). We selected a pilot set of 63 representative tumour–normal pairs, on which we ran the 3 core pipelines, together with a set of 10 additional somatic variant-calling pipelines contributed by members of the PCAWG SNV Calling Methods Working Group. Sufficient DNA remained for 50 of the 63 cases for validation, which was performed by hybridization of tumour and matched normal DNA to a custom RNA bait set, followed by deep sequencing, as previously described29. Although performed using the same sequencing chemistry as the original whole-genome sequencing analyses, the considerably greater depth achieved in the validation experiment enabled accurate assessment of sensitivity and precision of variant calls. Variant calls in repeat-masked regions were not tested, owing to the challenge of designing reliable validation probes in these areas.The 3 core pipelines had individual estimates of sensitivity of 80–90% to detect a true somatic SNV called by any of the 13 pipelines; with >95% of SNV calls made by each of the core pipelines being genuine somatic variants (Fig. 1a). For indels—a more-challenging class of variants to identify in short-read sequencing data—the 3 core algorithms had individual sensitivity estimates in the range of 40–50%, with precision 70–95% (Fig. 1b). Validation of SV calls is inherently more difficult, as methods based on PCR or hybridization to RNA baits often fail to isolate DNA that spans the breakpoint. To assess the accuracy of SV calls, we therefore used the property that an SV must either generate a copy-number change or be balanced, whereas artefactual calls will not respect this property. For individual SV-calling algorithms, we estimated precision to be in the range of 80–95% for samples in the 63-sample pilot dataset.Next, we examined multiple methods for merging calls made by several algorithms into a single definitive call-set to be used for downstream analysis. The final consensus calls for SNVs were based on a simple approach that required two or more methods to agree on a call. For indels, because methods were less concordant, we used stacked logistic regression110,111 to integrate the calls. The merged SV set includes all calls made by two or more of the four primary SV-calling algorithms96,100,112,113. Consensus CNA calls were obtained by joining the outputs of six individual CNA-calling algorithms with SV consensus breakpoints to obtain base-pair resolution CNAs (Supplementary Methods 2.4.3). Consensus purity and ploidy were derived, and a multi tier system was developed for consensus copy-number calls (Supplementary Methods 2.4.3, and described in detail elsewhere7).Overall, the sensitivity and precision of the consensus somatic variant calls were 95% (90% confidence interval, 88–98%) and 95% (90% confidence interval, 71–99%), respectively, for SNVs (Extended Data Fig. 2). For somatic indels, sensitivity and precision were 60% (90% confidence interval, 34–72%) and 91% (90% confidence interval, 73–96%), respectively. Regarding SVs, we estimate the sensitivity of the merging algorithm to be 90% for true calls generated by any one calling pipeline; precision was estimated to be 97.5%. That is, 97.5% of SVs in the merged SV call-set had an associated copy-number change or balanced partner rearrangement. The improvement in calling accuracy from combining different pipelines was most noticeable in variants that had low variant allele fractions, which are likely to originate from subclonal populations of the tumour (Fig. 1c, d). There remains much work to be done to improve indel calling software; we still lack sensitivity for calling even fully clonal complex indels from short-read sequencing data.
<NbChars_0.2><LevSim_0.2>Abstract|Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effect of CBD-ointment administered on severe skin chronic diseases and/or on their outcome scars. Methods: A spontaneous, anecdotal, retrospective study of 20 patients with two most frequent skin disorders: psoriasis (n: 5 patients), atopic dermatitis (n: 5) and resulting outcome scars (n: 10). The subjects were instructed to administer topical CBD-enriched ointment to lesioned skin areas twice daily for three months treatment. Results: Based on skin evaluations (hydration, TEWL, elasticity), clinical questionnaires (SCORAD, ADI, PASI), and supported by photographic data and investigators' clinical assessment, the results showed that topical treatment with CBD-enriched ointment significantly improved the skin parameters, the symptoms and also the PASI index score. No irritant or allergic reactions were documented during the period treatment. Conclusions: The topical administration of CBD ointment, without any THC, is a safe and effective non-invasive alternative for improve the quality of life in patients with some skin disorders, especially on inflammatory background.
<NbChars_0.6><LevSim_0.6>Abstract|Objective: To evaluate trends by race in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality obstetric-related quality and safety indicators and their relationships to trends in inpatient maternal and neonatal mortality. Methods: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2000 through 2009 and calculated obstetric hospital quality and patient safety indicators and inpatient maternal and neonatal mortality stratified by race. We examined differences in age and comorbidity-adjusted trends in black compared with white women over time in the United States and by geographic region. Proportions were analyzed by χ2 and trends by regression analysis. Results: Obstetric quality indicators varied by geographic region, but changes over time were consistent for both races. Cesarean deliveries increased similarly for black and white women, and vaginal births after cesarean delivery declined for both races but more rapidly for white women than for black women. Obstetric safety indicators improved over the study period for black and white women, with obstetric trauma decreasing significantly for both groups (28% compared with 35%, respectively) and birth trauma-injury to neonates declining for both, but changes were not significant. In striking contrast, inpatient maternal and neonatal mortality remained relatively constant during the study period, with persistently higher rates of both seen among black compared with white women (12.0 compared with 4.6 per 100,000 deliveries, P<.001 and 6.6 compared with 2.5 per 1,000 births, P<.001, respectively, in 2009). Conclusion: Improvements in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality quality indicators for obstetrics are not reflected in improvements in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and do not explain continued racial disparities for outcomes in pregnancies in black and white women. Quality measures that are related to pregnancy outcomes are needed and these should elucidate obstetric health disparities.
<NbChars_0.7><LevSim_0.6>Abstract|Background: Previous reports of lower triage acuity scores and longer Emergency Department (ED) wait times for African Americans compared to Caucasians had insufficient information to determine if this was due to bias or appropriately based on medical history and clinical presentation. Objective: (1) Determine if African Americans are assigned lower triage acuity scores (TAS) after adjusting for a number of demographic and clinical variables likely to affect triage scores. (2) Determine if lower TAS translate into clinically significant longer wait times to assignment to a treatment area. Methods: This was a retrospective matched cohort design analysis of de-identified data extracted from the ED electronic medical record system, which included demographic and clinical information, as well as TAS, and ED process times. Triage scores were assigned using a 5-point scale (ESI), with 1 being most urgent and 5 being least urgent. Mean TAS and wait times to a treatment area for specific chief complaints were compared by race; after adjusting for age, gender, insurance status, time of day, day of week, presence of co-morbidities, and abnormal vital signs using a 1:1 matched case analysis. Results: The overall mean TAS for African Americans was 2.97 vs. 2.81 for Caucasians (difference of 0.18; p<0.001), translating to a lower acuity rating. African Americans had a significantly longer wait time to a treatment area compared to case-matched Caucasians (10.9min; p<0.001), with much larger differences in wait times noted within certain specific chief complaint categories. Conclusion: Our current study supports the hypothesis that racial bias may influence the triage process.
<NbChars_0.6><LevSim_0.5>Abstract|Background: Versus whites, blacks with diabetes have poorer control of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), and higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as higher rates of morbidity and microvascular complications. Objective: To examine whether several mutable risk factors were more strongly associated with poor control of multiple intermediate outcomes among blacks with diabetes than among similar whites. Design: Case-control study. Subjects: A total of 764 blacks and whites with diabetes receiving care within 8 managed care health plans. Measures: Cases were patients with poor control of at least 2 of 3 intermediate outcomes (HbA1c > or =8.0%, SBP > or =140 mmHg, LDL cholesterol > or =130 mg/dL) and controls were patients with good control of all 3 (HbA1c <8.0%, SBP <140 mmHg, LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL). In multivariate analyses, we determined whether each of several potentially mutable risk factors, including depression, poor adherence to medications, low self-efficacy for reducing cardiovascular risk, and poor patient-provider communication, predicted case or control status. Results: Among blacks but not whites, in multivariate analyses depression (odds ratio: 2.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.09-4.75) and having missed medication doses (odds ratio: 1.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-3.81) were associated with greater odds of being a case rather than a control. None of the other risk factors were associated for either blacks or whites. Conclusions: Depression and missing medication doses are more strongly associated with poor diabetes control among blacks than in whites. These 2 risk factors may represent important targets for patient-level interventions to address racial disparities in diabetes outcomes.
<NbChars_0.5><LevSim_0.4>Abstract|Flexible transparent electrodes are in significant demand in applications including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and touch panels. The combination of high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity, however, sets a stringent requirement on electrodes based on metallic materials. To obtain practical sheet resistances, the visible transmittance of the electrodes in previous studies is typically lower than the transparent substrates the electrode structures are built on, namely, the transmittance relative to the substrate is <100%. Here, we demonstrate a flexible dielectric-metal-dielectric-based electrode with ~88.4% absolute transmittance, even higher than the ~88.1% transmittance of the polymer substrate, which results in a relative transmittance of ~100.3%. This non-trivial performance is achieved by leveraging an optimized dielectric-metal-dielectric structure guided by analytical and quantitative principles described in this work, and is attributed to an ultra-thin and ultra-smooth copper-doped silver film with low optical loss and low sheet resistance.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.4>Introduction|Transparent electrodes are widely used in photovoltaics (PVs)1,2, light-emitting diodes (LEDs)3,4,5, touch panels6,7, and other optoelectronic devices. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is the conventional selection for the transparent electrode because of its high visible transmittance and electrical conductivity. However, the low abundance of the indium element on earth is a limiting factor of this material. In addition, its applications in emerging flexible optoelectronic devices are significantly hindered by both the poor mechanical flexibility and the high annealing temperature needed to reduce its resistivity8. Graphene9,10, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)11,12, and conductive polymers13 have been investigated to replace ITO. Unfortunately, their limited conductivity and high cost of mass-production remains a challenge in large-area applications. To overcome these limitations, transparent electrodes employing metal networks have been proposed14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Although these novel structures exhibit decent optical and electrical performance and can also be scaled up easily via different roll-to-roll (R2R) techniques24,25, the extruded or non-uniform surfaces may cause shorting problems when being used in LED and PV devices14. In addition, the high optical haze resulting from the scattering of the nanowires and mesh patterns is undesired in high-resolution displays14. In recent years, dielectric–metal–dielectric (DMD)-based transparent electrodes have been noted as potential alternatives. In this type of electrode, a thin metallic film is sandwiched between two antireflection dielectrics to induce high transparency. They feature high transparency and conductivity, low haze, excellent flexibility, facile fabrication, and great compatibility with different substrates2,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. The trade-off between electrical conductivity and optical transmittance has been a major challenge for metallic-material-based transparent electrodes. To achieve a practical conductivity (e.g., sheet resistance (Rs) < 20 Ω sq−1), the absolute visible transmittance of previously reported metallic-material-based transparent electrodes, including both metal network and DMD structures, is typically lower than that of the substrate itself, which has been taken for granted without serious questioning.Therefore, we are motivated to conduct a rigorous investigation and explore the limit of transmittance at a sufficiently low sheet resistance suitable for practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a DMD-based transparent electrode with ~88.4% absolute transmittance averaged over the entire visible spectrum (400–700 nm) on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymeric substrate, which surpasses the transmittance of the substrate itself (~88.1%), leading to a relative transmittance >100%. This counter-intuitive, yet achievable performance is obtained by (i) quantitative design principles that are generalized in this work, particularly, analytic expression of the optimal bottom dielectric thickness and analytical result showing that different materials should be used for the two dielectrics, (ii) the use of an ultra-thin (~6.5 nm thick) and ultra-smooth (roughness < 1 nm) copper-doped silver (Cu-doped Ag) film providing low optical loss and high electrical conductivity at the same time. The proposed design principles and electrode structures have resolved the problems faced by other existing transparent electrodes and may have the potential to replace traditional ITO counterparts for flexible optoelectronics, thus facilitating high-performance flexible displays and optoelectronic devices.
<NbChars_0.1><LevSim_0.1>Results|Strategy to achieve relative transmittance surpassing 100%Relative transmittance, Tr, is defined as the ratio of the absolute transmittance of the structure where a transparent substrate is coated with a metallic electrode, TD (see Fig. 1a), to the absolute transmittance of the bare substrate, TS (Fig. 1b):$$T_{\mathrm{r}} = \frac{{T_{\mathrm{D}}}}{{T_{\mathrm{S}}}} \approx \frac{{1 - \left( {R_1 + A} \right) - R_2}}{{1 - R_2 - R_2}}.$$ (1) where R1 is the reflection at the top side of DMD and A is the absorption of the metallic film, and R2 is the reflection at the substrate/air interface. For simplicity, the multiple round-trip reflections between the front and bottom surfaces of the substrate are ignored due to the negligible reflection intensity at both interfaces. Intuitively, Tr is thought to be smaller than 100% because a metallic electrode is usually reflective. However, in this section, we will provide guidelines built around the antireflection principles to reduce R1 and A using the DMD structure, and show that with optimized design (R1 + A) can be made smaller than the single side reflection of the substrate, R2, leading to relative transmittance surpassing 100%.Fig. 1: The definition of relative transmission. a Transparent substrate coated with a DMD structure. b Bare substrate.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 2a, seven parameters (the refractive index, n2, and thickness, d2, of the transparent Dielectric 1, the refractive index, n3, extinction coefficient, κ3, and thickness, d3, of the metallic film, and the refractive index, n4, and thickness, d4, of the transparent Dielectric 2) should all be considered in order to optimize the transmittance over a broad spectrum in the visible, which makes it challenging to provide quantitative design guidelines33,34,35. Our design strategy is to maximize the transmittance for the condition where the metallic film is thick enough to achieve a practical sheet resistance; and thus, this strategy enables the synergistic combination of high optical transmittance and high electrical conductivity of DMD-based transparent electrodes.Fig. 2: Theoretical design of a DMD electrode.a Design parameters and reflection waves at various interfaces of a DMD transparent electrode. b Phasor diagram of reflection waves. c An ideal DMD and its parameters. d The calculated values of the left and right terms in Eq. (9) when using 24 nm TiO2 and 9 nm Ag as Dielectric 2 and the metallic layer, respectively, in the DMD structure, showing that Eq. (9) is well satisfied across the entire visible range. e Optimal averaged transmittance of the DMD electrode across the visible range (400–700 nm) dependent on the thickness of Dielectric 2. Here, TiO2 and 9 nm Ag are used as the bottom dielectric layer and the middle metallic layer, respectively. Each optimal transmittance value at a fixed TiO2 thickness is found out by sweeping the refractive index (n2) and the thickness (d2) of Dielectric 1.Full size imageAs a first step in the design process, a suitable material is selected for the sandwiched metallic layer by considering its (i) electrical conductivity; (ii) light absorption property in the visible range. Among all metals, silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and gold (Au) exhibit the lowest intrinsic electrical resistivity. The absorption of light by the metallic film in a DMD structure is expressed as$$A\left( {\lambda _0} \right) = \frac{{4\pi n_3\kappa _3}}{{\lambda _0}}\frac{{{\int}_0^{d_3} {\left| {E\left( z \right)} \right|^2{\mathrm{d}}z} }}{{\left| {E_0} \right|^2}},$$ (2) where E(z) is the electric field in the metallic film, E0 is the incident electric field and λ0 is the free-space wavelength. With a given thickness of the metallic layer, a metal with a small (nk) should be chosen for low absorption and high transmittance. Among Ag, Cu, and Au, Ag (n = 0.13 and k = 3.17 at 550 nm wavelength38) offers the lowest (nk) in the visible range, and is therefore, employed as the metallic layer in this study. Considering the small real part refractive index of Ag, n3 = 0 is reasonably assumed for the rest of this section for simplicity.In the next step, the thickness and the refractive index of Dielectric 2 are determined. To reduce the reflection loss at the top surface, the sum of two vectors shown in Fig. 2a should be designed to cancel r12, which is the complex reflection coefficient at the interface (1–2 interface) between the air (n1 = 1) and Dielectric 1 (\(r_{pq} = ( {\widetilde n_p{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{cos}}{\kern 1pt} \theta _p - \widetilde n_q{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{cos}}{\kern 1pt} \theta _q} )/( {\widetilde n_p{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{cos}}{\kern 1pt} \theta _p + \widetilde n_q{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{cos}}{\kern 1pt} \theta _q} )\) is the reflection coefficient at p–q interface for TE polarization where \(\widetilde n_{p(q)} = n_{p(q)} + {\mathrm{i}}\kappa _{p(q)}\) is the complex refractive index of layer p(q) and \(\theta _{p(q)}\) is the direction of wave propagation in the corresponding layer). The first vector is r23 with a phase shift acquired from the wave propagation in Dielectric 1. The second is r3,45 with a magnitude attenuation resulting from the propagation in the metallic film and with a phase shift due to the propagation in Dielectric 1. r3,45 is the total reflection coefficient at 3–4 interface (where the light reflected from the interface between 4 and 5 is taken into account), and can be expressed as$$r_{3,45} = \frac{{r_{34} + r_{45}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_4d_4} \right)}}{{1 + r_{34}r_{45}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_4d_4} \right)}}.$$ (3) In order to cancel out each other yielding R1 = 0, the trajectory of these three vectors should be a triangle or they should be aligned in the way as shown in Fig. 2b, therefore$$\left| {r_{3,45}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }{\mathrm{i}}\kappa _3d_3} \right){\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right| \ge \left| {r_{23}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right| - \left| {r_{12}} \right|.$$ (4) Since n3 = 0 as we assumed,$$\left| {r_{23}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right| = 1 > \left| {r_{12}} \right|,$$ (5) $$\left| {r_{23}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right| = 1 > \left| {r_{3,45}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }{\mathrm{i}}\kappa _3d_3} \right){\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{i}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right|,$$ (6) Thus, the right term in Eq. (4) represents the minimum value of the left term, which is achieved when the three vectors are aligned in the way as shown in Fig. 2b. In this case, we have$$\left| {r_{3,45}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }{\mathrm{i}}\kappa _3d_3} \right){\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right| = \left| {r_{23}{\kern 1pt} {\mathrm{exp}}{\kern 1pt} \left( {2{\mathrm{{i}}}\frac{{2{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2} \right)} \right| - \left| {r_{12}} \right|,$$ (7) When the left term in Eq. (4) is smaller than this minimum value, the reflection cannot be completely suppressed.Since the left term in Eq. (4) decreases with increasing metallic film thickness (d3), |r3,45| should be designed to achieve its maximum value so that Eq. (4) can be satisfied for maximum metallic film thickness to achieve high electrical conductivity. To maximize |r3,45|, r34, and r45 should interfere constructively with each other so that$$\psi _{{\mathrm{prop}}} + \psi _{45} - \psi _{34} = 0,$$ (8) where ψ34 is the phase angle of r34, representing the phase shift due to the reflection at 3–4 interface, and ψ45 is the phase angle of r45, representing the reflection phase shift at 4–5 interface. n4 > n5 (shown later) gives ψ45 = 0. ψprop = 4πn4d4/λ is the propagation phase shift picked up when the wave is propagating in Dielectric 2. Then we get$$\psi _{34} = \frac{{4{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_4d_4.$$ (9) Since |r3,45| increases with n4 (see Supplementary Fig. 1), materials of high refractive index should be used as Dielectric 2 to achieve the maximum value of |r3,45| and its thickness can be calculated using Eq. (9). It is interesting to notice that \(\psi _{34} = {\mathrm{arctan}}{\kern 1pt} \left[ {2\kappa _3n_4/\left( {\kappa _3^2 - n_4^2} \right)} \right]\) decreases with wavelength due to the increase of κ3 with the wavelength for Ag, and the value of 4πn4d4/λ also decreases with the wavelength. Therefore, Eq. (9) can be potentially self-fulfilled over a broad spectrum, resulting in broadband high transmittance.Finally, the refractive index and the thickness of Dielectric 1 are suitably selected for the optimal transmittance. The phasor diagram in Fig. 2b also gives$$\psi _{23} - \psi _{3,45} = {\mathrm{\pi }},$$ (10) $$\psi _{23} + \frac{{4{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2 - \psi _{12} = {\mathrm{\pi }}.$$ (11) Substituting ψ12 = π into Eq. (11) gives$$\psi _{23} + \frac{{4{\mathrm{\pi }}}}{\lambda }n_2d_2 = 0.$$ (12) 4πn2d2/λ decreases with the wavelength and \(\psi _{23} = {\mathrm{arctan}}{\kern 1pt} \left[ {2\kappa _3n_2/\left( {\kappa _3^2 - n_2^2} \right)} \right]\) also decreases with the wavelength because κ3 increases with the wavelength for Ag. Unlike Eq. (9), Eq. (12) cannot be satisfied over a broad spectrum. Thus, to achieve broadband high transmittance, we need to sweep the refractive index and the thickness of Dielectric 1 within a small range to find out the optimal value. Since the refractive index of typical dielectrics are between ~1.38 (magnesium fluoride, MgF2) and ~2.6 (titanium dioxide, TiO2), the required efforts are significantly reduced compared to the case where the refractive indices and thicknesses of all the three D–M–D layers need to be optimized.Now, we summarize the design procedure for highly transparent DMD electrodes. Step 1 (select n3, κ3, and d3): choose a low-loss and highly conductive metallic film for the DMD layer (in most cases, use Ag). The metallic film thickness is designed to achieve the electrical conductivity required in practical applications. It is worth noting that higher overall transmittance can be achieved by using a thinner metallic film. Step 2 (select n4): use high refractive index materials for Dielectric 2. The larger n4 is used, the higher overall transmittance can be obtained. Step 3 (determine d4): the thickness of Dielectric 2 is calculated using Eq. (9). Step 4 (design n2 and d2): optimize the refractive index and the thickness of Dielectric 1 within a small range to achieve the optimal broadband transmittance.Proof of conceptFirst, we use the results for an ideal DMD structure at a single wavelength (Fig. 2c) reported in a previous study39 to verify the design guidance provided in Eqs. (9), (10), and (12). According to ref. 39, an ideal DMD can be achieved at a selected wavelength for n1 = n5 = 1, n3 = 0, n2 = n4 = κ3, and d2 = d4 = λ/(8κ3). Substituting n4 = κ3 into Eq. (9) gives d4 = λ/(8κ3), substituting n2 = κ3 into Eq. (12) gives d2 = λ/(8κ3), and substituting n4 = κ3 into Eq. (10) gives n2 = n4, all of which are perfectly consistent with the conclusions obtained in ref. 39.In realistic cases, the substrate cannot be air (i.e., n5 ≠ n1) and the refractive indices of common dielectrics are usually much smaller than the extinction coefficients of metals in the visible range (i.e., n4 « κ3). This implies that different materials are required for Dielectrics 1 and 2 in a realistic DMD structure targeting optimal broadband transparency, i.e., n2 ≠ n4. However, the same material was used for Dielectrics 1 and 2 in most of the previous studies (more than 70 published works28), which means those results are not optimal in terms of optical transmittance and indicates the necessity of providing quantitative guidelines in order to obtain optimized DMD electrode designs.Next, the optical performance of a DMD electrode on a common optical substrate, PET, is designed based on our proposed guidelines. The flexible PET substrate exhibits an averaged absolute transmittance of ~88.0% from 400 to 700 nm as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. A 9-nm-thick Ag film is employed as the middle metallic layer and a TiO2 film with recorded-high n4 = 2.6 reported in ref. 27 is used for Dielectric 2. At the center wavelength of the visible range (i.e., 550 nm), ψ34 is calculated as 1.37, which leads to Dielectric 2 thickness d4 = 24 nm according to Eq. (9). As displayed in Fig. 2d, Eq. (9) is satisfied over the entire visible spectrum at d4 = 24 nm because both the left (ψ34) and right (4πn4d4/λ) terms of the equation decreases with the wavelength, which is consistent with our prediction in the above discussion. As summarized in Fig. 2e, a more straightforward way to find out the optimal d4 value at which the DMD structure presents the highest averaged transmittance in the visible range (400–700 nm) is to sweep d4 within a range (e.g., from 10 to 50 nm) and obtain the best transmittance at each d4 value by sweeping the refractive index (n2) and the thickness (d2) of Dielectric 1. As seen from the plot, the highest averaged absolute transmittance of ~89.8% is achieved at d4 = 24 nm, which agrees perfectly with the calculated results using Eq. (9) and thereby validates the accuracy of our proposed method. Correspondingly, the refractive index and the thickness of Dielectric 1 are n2 = 1.7 and d2 = 63 nm, respectively, when the highest transmittance is achieved at d4 = 24 nm. The absolute transmittance and reflectance spectra of the optimized structure, i.e., PET substrate/24 nm TiO2/9 nm Ag/63 nm Dielectric 1, spanning the entire visible range is provided in Supplementary Fig. 3. This n2 can be realized by Al2O3 film fabricated using common deposition methods. The relative transmittance of the optimized DMD electrode Tr is ~102.0% compared to the simulated transmittance (~88.0%) of the PET substrate, which indicates that our proposed design procedure effectively guarantees the optimal optical performance of the DMD structure and a relative transmittance >100% is achievable with suitable material selection and structure design.Experimental demonstrationsBased on the previous analysis, high transparency can be achieved by suppressing the metal absorption loss with thin Ag films. However, large surface roughness is an unavoidable issue for physical-vapor-deposited (evaporated or sputtered) ultra-thin (<20 nm) Ag films due to Ag atom’s intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) Volmer–Weber growth mode40. As an example, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of an evaporated 15 nm Ag film can be as large as 6 nm41. Such an issue will affect the film conductivity and induce additional scattering loss, thereby impairing both electrical and optical performance of the DMD electrodes.We recently demonstrated a novel approach to achieve ultra-thin (down to 6 nm) and ultra-smooth (RMS roughness < 1 nm) Ag film by doping a metallic element (e.g., Aluminum, Copper, Titanium, or Chromium) during Ag deposition (as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 4)2,5,29,42. In this work, we choose Cu-doped Ag as the metallic layer as this film offers the lowest optical loss among different doped Ag films5. The deposition rates of Cu and Ag were chosen as 0.19 and 11.09 Å s−1, respectively, which corresponds to ~2% Cu atomic concentration. The added Cu atoms effectively suppress the 3D island formation of the Ag atoms during film deposition and promote an early-stage formation of ultra-thin (<10 nm) Ag films. An atomic force microscopy (AFM) image showing details of a 6.5-nm-thick Cu-doped Ag film deposited on a fused silica substrate is displayed in Fig. 3a. The RMS roughness of the film is measured to be ~0.47 nm, which is more than 10 times lower than that of pure Ag at a similar thickness reported in previous works2,5,41. A 3D view of the AFM scan is further provided in Supplementary Fig. 5 to show the surface morphology and roughness of the ultrathin Cu-doped Ag film.Fig. 3: Characterizations of a Cu-doped Ag thin film.a Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterizations of a Cu-doped Ag thin film. The scale bar is 100 nm. b Measured relative permittivity (ε = ε1 + iε2) values as a function of free-space wavelength of Cu-doped Ag and pure Ag. The shaded region refers to the visible range (400–700 nm), over which our DMD electrode is optimized.Full size imageAs a direct representation of the light absorption property of a film, the imaginary part (ε2) of the measured permittivity (ε = ε1 + iε2 = (n + iκ)2) of the 6.5-nm-thick Cu-doped Ag (Fig. 3b) is very close to that of pure Ag in the visible range (400–700 nm), which indicates the low optical loss of the ultrathin Cu-doped Ag film. Here, a 20 nm-thick pure Ag film was sputter-deposited for the calibration and the refractive indices of both Cu-doped Ag and pure Ag films were characterized using the spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the sheet resistance of this thin Cu-doped Ag film was measured as ~18.6 Ω sq−1, showing the high conductivity of the ultrathin Cu-doped Ag film.Next, a DMD-based transparent electrode is constructed employing this 6.5-nm-thick Cu-doped Ag. Here, ~50-μm-thick PET film, which exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility, is used as the substrate. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is selected as Dielectric 2 due to its high refractive index (n ~ 2.0) and negligible optical loss in the visible range (ZnO is the highest refractive index material achievable in our group). The refractive indices of PET, ZnO, and Cu-doped Ag across the whole visible wavelength range are provided in Supplementary Fig. 6. The thickness (d4) of Dielectric 2 is calculated as ~24 nm with Eq. (9) considering n4 ~ 2.05 and ñ3 ~ 0.19 + 3.39i at 550 nm wavelength. As shown in Fig. 4a, the interesting compensation between the left (ψ34) and right (4πn4d4/λ) sides of Eq. (9) spanning 400–700 nm is also effectively verified in this case. Thus, 24 nm ZnO is an optimal selection not only for a single wavelength (550 nm) but also for the entire visible range. As the last step, the refractive index and the thickness of the top dielectric (Dielectric 1) is swept from 1.3 to 2.6 and from 1 to 100 nm with a step of 0.05 and 1 nm, respectively, to find out the optimal combination for the highest averaged absolute transmittance across the 400–700 nm wavelength range. Figure 4b shows that n2 = 1.65 and d2 = 56 nm for the optimal condition and this n2 is close to the refractive index of Al2O3. By applying the measured refractive index of Al2O3 (Supplementary Fig. 6), d2 was re-optimized and is still equal to 56 nm.Fig. 4: Experimental demonstration of the designed DMD electrode.a The calculated values of the left and right terms in Eq. (9) when using 24 nm ZnO and 6.5 nm Cu-doped Ag as Dielectric 2 and the metallic layer, respectively, in the DMD structure. It shows Eq. (9) is well satisfied across the entire visible range. b Averaged absolute visible transmittance (%) of the DMD electrode dependent on the refractive index and the thickness of the top dielectric (Dielectric 1) when Dielectric 2 and the metallic layer are selected as 24 nm ZnO and 6.5 nm Cu-doped Ag, respectively. c Calculated (red solid curve) and measured (blue dashed curve) absolute transmittance from 400 to 700 nm of the designed DMD transparent electrode, showing great consistency with each other. The representative measured spectrum with an averaged transmittance of ~88.4% is taken from the measurement results of 15 samples. As a comparison, one representative transmittance spectrum of the bare PET substrate with the averaged transmittance of ~88.1% is provided to show how the optical performance of the optimized DMD electrode gets improved. Inset presents the configuration of the designed DMD electrode, i.e., PET substrate/24 nm ZnO/6.5 nm Cu-doped Ag/56 nm Al2O3. d A photograph of the fabricated flexible electrode, showing high transparent and neutral appearance.Full size imageAs illustrated in the inset in Fig. 4c, the final configuration of the DMD transparent electrode is determined as PET substrate/24 nm ZnO/6.5 nm Cu-doped Ag/56 nm Al2O3. The measured and simulated optical spectra of the designed electrode are presented in Fig. 4c, showing great consistency with each other. The averaged absolute transmittances across 400–700 nm calculated from experimental and theoretical results are ~(88.4 ± 0.1)% and ~88.4%, respectively. Figure 4c clearly shows that the transmittance of the DMD electrode is higher than the absolute transmittance of the bare PET substrate (~(88.1 ± 0.4)% from the measurement) with the optical transmittance from 416 to 607 nm effectively enhanced with the two antireflection dielectrics. Here, the cited uncertainties above represent one standard deviation of the measured data. The experimental averaged transmittances of the DMD electrode and the PET substrate are calculated with the measurement results of 15 samples. Detailed data can be found in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 7. In contrast to all the results reported in previous works, the relative transmittance of our proposed DMD electrode surpasses 100% (Tr ~ 100.3% based on the measurement data) as its optical loss (~11.6%) resulting from the stack reflection and absorption (=100%−transmittance) is well suppressed below the ~11.9% optical loss of the bare PET substrate (Supplementary Fig. 2). The angular performance of the DMD electrode is further investigated in Supplementary Fig. 8, which shows that high transmittance >75% is maintained up to 60° angle of incidence. A photograph of the fabricated flexible DMD structure on the PET substrate is displayed in Fig. 4d, which clearly shows the high transparency.It is worthwhile noting that even higher transmittance can be achieved by using a bottom dielectric of higher refractive index than that of ZnO, such as TiO2 (whose refractive index is about 2.6 in the visible range27,43,44). In this case, the thickness of the high-index TiO2 layer is determined as d4 = 22 nm using Eq. (9). The refractive index and the thickness of Dielectric 1 are optimized as n2 = 1.6 and d2 = 72 nm, respectively, by sweeping n2 and d2 within a broad range. The optimal structure ‘PET substrate/22 nm TiO2/6.5 nm Cu-doped Ag/72 nm Dielectric 1’ gives out an averaged absolute transmittance of 89.6% across 400–700 nm, which corresponds to a relative transmittance of ~101.8% as presented in Supplementary Fig. 9.Finally, we discuss the functionality of our designed DMD electrode and other material options depending on the intended applications. Firstly, the use of the insulating Al2O3 layer will make the proposed DMD structure an excellent candidate for the transparent heat mirror28, that can be used for window defrosting or deicing applications. Secondly, to use the DMD structure as an electrode in optoelectronic devices, the Al2O3 layer can be replaced by other dielectric materials featuring a similar refractive index that can also function as an effective electron/hole transport layer. Possible candidates include ZnO sol–gel films1, which are commonly used as electron transport layers in solar cells and organic LEDs (OLEDs). Due to its porous structure, the refractive index is much lower than that of a dense ZnO film prepared by vacuum-deposition methods and is very close to the ideal refractive index (n2 = 1.65) required in our design (Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, our proposed design principles are not limited to treating the ambient as air, in Supplementary Information we show that they are also applicable when designing a DMD electrode used in a solar cell, as an example of optoelectronic devices (see Supplementary Fig. 11 for more details). Thirdly, the dielectric layers (ZnO and Al2O3) also play a critical role in protecting the ultrathin metallic film from degradation. As presented in Supplementary Fig. 12, the DMD electrode on the PET substrate has survived the accelerated test under high temperature and humidity (85 °C, 85% relative humidity), showing ~12.6% change of the sheet resistance after 120 h test, while the sheet resistance of the ultrathin Cu-doped Ag without any protections increases quickly to infinity under the same test condition after 8 h.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.4>Discussion|Relative transmittance higher than 100% was achieved in this work by the integration of a novel Cu-doped Ag film into an optimized DMD structure. This Cu-doped Ag film features ultra-thin thickness (~6.5 nm thick), ultra-smooth morphology (roughness < 1 nm), low optical loss, and high electrical conductivity (sheet resistance ~18.6 Ω sq−1), and was fabricated using a room-temperature deposition method. The optimized DMD structure was designed by quantitative principles that were generalized for the first time in this work. We experimentally demonstrated that the flexible DMD-based electrode, although not optimal, has 88.4% absolute averaged transmittance over the visible spectrum, which is higher than 88.1% transmittance of its PET substrate. This study provides an exciting pathway to address the major challenge faced by existing flexible transparent electrodes and to replace traditional ITO counterparts, thus facilitating high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.
<NbChars_1.8><LevSim_0.4>Methods|Film depositionMaterials used in this work were all deposited by sputtering (LAB 18, Kurt J. Lesker Co.). Cu-doped Ag films were deposited by DC co-sputtering from Cu and Ag targets with 4.5 mTorr argon (Ar) pressure. The optimized deposition rates of Cu and Ag were 0.19 and 11.09 Å s−1. Pure Ag was deposited by DC sputtering for 12.4 Å s−1 and 4.5 mTorr condition. ZnO and Al2O3 films were deposited by RF sputtering with 4.5 and 3.0 mTorr Ar pressure, respectively.Material and optical characterizationsAll optical simulations were performed using the transfer matrix method. The refractive indices and thicknesses of materials and transmission spectra of electrodes were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry method (M-2000, J. A. Woollam Inc.). The reflection spectra of the fabricated electrodes were measured by a thin-film measurement instrument (F20, Filmetrics) integrated with a spectrometer and light source. The sheet resistances were measured using a four-point probe method (FPP-5000, Miller Design & Equipment). The surface morphology of Cu-doped Ag films was characterized by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (Dimension Icon AFM, Bruker Corporation).
<NbChars_0.6><LevSim_0.6>Abstract|Purpose: Health providers' implicit racial bias negatively affects communication and patient reactions to many medical interactions. However, its effects on racially discordant oncology interactions are largely unknown. Thus, we examined whether oncologist implicit racial bias has similar effects in oncology interactions. We further investigated whether oncologist implicit bias negatively affects patients' perceptions of recommended treatments (i.e., degree of confidence, expected difficulty). We predicted oncologist implicit bias would negatively affect communication, patient reactions to interactions, and, indirectly, patient perceptions of recommended treatments. Methods: Participants were 18 non-black medical oncologists and 112 black patients. Oncologists completed an implicit racial bias measure several weeks before video-recorded treatment discussions with new patients. Observers rated oncologist communication and recorded interaction length of time and amount of time oncologists and patients spoke. Following interactions, patients answered questions about oncologists' patient-centeredness and difficulty remembering contents of the interaction, distress, trust, and treatment perceptions. Results: As predicted, oncologists higher in implicit racial bias had shorter interactions, and patients and observers rated these oncologists' communication as less patient-centered and supportive. Higher implicit bias also was associated with more patient difficulty remembering contents of the interaction. In addition, oncologist implicit bias indirectly predicted less patient confidence in recommended treatments, and greater perceived difficulty completing them, through its impact on oncologists' communication (as rated by both patients and observers). Conclusion: Oncologist implicit racial bias is negatively associated with oncologist communication, patients' reactions to racially discordant oncology interactions, and patient perceptions of recommended treatments. These perceptions could subsequently directly affect patient-treatment decisions. Thus, implicit racial bias is a likely source of racial treatment disparities and must be addressed in oncology training and practice.
<NbChars_0.6><LevSim_0.5>Abstract|Objective: To determine the household and community characteristics most closely associated with variation in COVID-19 incidence on American Indian reservations in the lower 48 states. Design: Multivariate analysis with population weights. Setting: Two hundred eighty-seven American Indian Reservations and tribal homelands (in Oklahoma) and, as of April 10, 2020, 861 COVID-19 cases on these reservation lands. Main outcome measures: The relationship between rate per 1000 individuals of publicly reported COVID-19 cases at the tribal reservation and/or community level and average household characteristics from the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey records. Results: By April 10, 2020, in regression analysis, COVID-19 cases were more likely by the proportion of homes lacking indoor plumbing (10.83, P = .001) and were less likely according to the percentage of reservation households that were English-only (-2.43, P = .03). Household overcrowding measures were not statistically significant in this analysis (-6.40, P = .326). Conclusions: Failure to account for the lack of complete indoor plumbing and access to potable water in a pandemic may be an important determinant of the increased incidence of COVID-19 cases. Access to relevant information that is communicated in the language spoken by many reservation residents may play a key role in the spread of COVID-19 in some tribal communities. Household overcrowding does not appear to be associated with COVID-19 infections in our data at the current time. Previous studies have identified household plumbing and overcrowding, and language, as potential pandemic and disease infection risk factors. These risk factors persist. Funding investments in tribal public health and household infrastructure, as delineated in treaties and other agreements, are necessary to protect American Indian communities.
<NbChars_0.7><LevSim_0.6>Abstract|With the ever-increasing availability of whole-genome sequences, machine-learning approaches can be used as an alternative to traditional alignment-based methods for identifying new antimicrobial-resistance genes. Such approaches are especially helpful when pathogens cannot be cultured in the lab. In previous work, we proposed a game-theory-based feature evaluation algorithm. When using the protein characteristics identified by this algorithm, called ‘features’ in machine learning, our model accurately identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in Gram-negative bacteria. Here we extend our study to Gram-positive bacteria showing that coupling game-theory-identified features with machine learning achieved classification accuracies between 87% and 90% for genes encoding resistance to the antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin. Importantly, we present a standalone software tool that implements the game-theory algorithm and machine-learning model used in these studies.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.5>Introduction|Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to a property of bacteria when they become less susceptible to an antimicrobial agent1,2,3,4. Bacteria can gain AMR by overexpressing or duplicating available genes, undergoing chromosomal mutation, or obtaining resistance genes from other bacteria by means of horizontal gene transfer1, 5. According to a recently released report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 2.8 million people in the United States are infected every year by antimicrobial-resistant organisms, and these infections result in more than 35,000 deaths6. Also, according to a recently released report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2.4 million deaths are predicted in Europe, North America, and Australia in the next 30 years due to antimicrobial-resistant infections, and such infections could cause up to US$3.5 billion in additional health care costs per year7, 8. As AMR becomes a threat worldwide, both economically and to public health9,10,11,12,13, there is an urgent need to develop a preclinical tool for efficient prediction of AMR.One conventional strategy for identifying genetically-encoded mechanisms for AMR involves sequence assembly14,15,16,17 and read-based techniques18,19,20 that map sequence data directly to reference databases. Although these methods perform well for known and highly conserved AMR genes, they may produce an unacceptable number of false positives (genes predicted to encode resistance when they do not) for highly dissimilar sequences as was demonstrated previously for Gram-negative bacteria21. Machine-learning techniques can be applied as an alternative solution for predicting putative AMR genes. Rather than using sequence similarity, a machine-learning model detects features, i.e., characteristics of a protein sequence, that are unique to AMR genes. Several machine-learning methods have been proposed to identify novel AMR genes from metagenomic and pan-genome data12, 22, 23, but these methods used a small number of genetic features for predictions. Moreover, these approaches did not use a feature-selection strategy to remove irrelevant and redundant features that might compromise the accuracy of a machine-learning model.We recently introduced a game-theory-based feature selection approach (“game theoretic dynamic weighting based feature evaluation”, or GTDWFE) predicated on the supposition that a single feature might provide limited predictive value, but that it might contribute to form a strong coalition when used with other features21. We applied our feature selection approach in Gram-negative bacteria and obtained prediction accuracies ranging from 93% to 99% for prediction of genes that encode resistance to acetyltransferase (aac), \(\beta \)-lactamase (bla), and dihydrofolate reductase (dfr). In our current study, we test the GTDWFE algorithm with data from Gram-positive bacteria. We then combine the results for both studies and introduce “Prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance via Game Theory” (PARGT), a software program with a graphical-user interface (GUI) that is designed to identify antimicrobial-resistance genes for both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.A major objective was to develop a software tool with a simple and intuitive GUI that is capable of extracting protein features without the need for manual curation and then use these features to identify putative AMR genes. PARGT integrates all of the tools and scripts required to identify protein features and to automatically generate feature subsets obtained via the GTDWFE algorithm. PARGT can be used with the Windows, Linux, or macOS, operating systems, and it provides options for predicting bac and van resistance genes in any Gram-positive bacteria and aac, bla, and dfr resistance genes in any Gram-negative bacteria. Users can test a single sequence or an entire genome for these genes. In addition, PARGT allows users to add newly confirmed AMR or non-AMR sequences to the training set as well as to reset the training data back to the original training set downloaded with the tool.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.4>Results|Validation of PARGTWe validated the GTDWFE algorithm for feature selection as implemented previously21. In our earlier work, we considered the AMR (positive) and non-AMR (negative) amino-acid sequences of aac, bla, and dfr for Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia as training datasets and tested our trained support vector machine (SVM)24, 25 machine-learning model with sequences from Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and Enterobacter. The combination of GTDWFE and SVM resulted in correct classification rates of 93%, 99%, and 97% for aac, bla, and dfr, respectively. This demonstrated that our approach was promising and that the GTDWFE algorithm is capable of identifying the most relevant, non-redundant, and interdependent features necessary for accurate prediction.In this paper we consider validation of our GTDWFE model for AMR proteins in Gram-positive bacteria. We use the unique AMR and non-AMR sequences available for bac and van from the Gram-positive bacteria Clostridium spp. and Enterococcus spp. as the training datasets for our SVM model. These training datasets are used to generate the best feature subsets by means of the GTDWFE approach. The training datasets contain 25 and 52 AMR (positive) examples for bac and van, respectively. A total of 52 non-AMR examples are considered as negative samples for each of the training datasets. In the GTDWFE approach, we select features based on the relevance, non-redundancy, and interdependency values of all features. For this analysis, we need to set an interdependent group size \(\delta \) to measure the interdependency between features, where \(\delta \) is used in the computation of the Banzhaf power index26 and indicates the size of each feature group. We selected a value of \(\delta =3\) based on previous work21 where we found that an interdependent group size of 3 was sufficient to identify best feature subsets from training datasets. We then test our trained model with known AMR and non-AMR samples from Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Listeria. The test datasets contain 6 and 9 AMR (positive) sequences for bac and van, respectively, and 14 non-AMR (negative) sequences are used for each test dataset.Table 1 Predicted bac AMR sequences for Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Listeria using the GTDWFE algorithm.Full size table Table 2 Predicted van AMR sequences for Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Listeria using the GTDWFE algorithm.Full size table Tables 1 and 2 list the predicted bac and van AMR sequences from our test datasets, respectively. In each table, we provide the NCBI accession number27 for each protein sequence together with its name, and we note whether an AMR protein was correctly classified as AMR (true positive) or a non-AMR sequence was incorrectly classified as AMR (false positive). The GTDWFE algorithm successfully identified all six bac AMR genes (true positives). However, it missclassified 2 of the 14 non-AMR sequences as AMR (false positives). Therefore, the number of true positives, true negatives (negatives accurately classified), false positives, and false negatives (positives classified as negatives) for bac are 6, 12, 2, and 0, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for bac are 100%, 86%, and 90%, respectively. As shown in Table 2 for van, 8 of 9 AMR sequences were correctly classified as AMR (true positives) whereas 2 of 14 non-AMR sequences were classified as AMR (false positives). Therefore, the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for van are 8, 12, 2, and 1, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for van are 89%, 86%, and 87%, respectively. Note that the two tables contain one hypothetical protein and one putative uncharacterized protein. We have categorized these two proteins as false positives because they were identified as essential (non-AMR) genes in the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC)28, 29. However, it is quite possible that PARGT correctly identified them as AMR proteins given the number of annotation errors in public databases30. CDC71755 is from a Staphylococcus organism identified from a metagenome sequence, and EUJ19660 is from a Listeria aquatica organism obtained from an environmental water sample.Performance comparison with BLASTp and Kalign toolsWe also compared the performance of our GTDWFE algorithm with BLASTp (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) and Kalign31 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/kalign/) results using default parameter settings. The outcomes shown in Supplementary Table S1 are the percent identities for bac AMR and non-AMR samples from Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Listeria with respect to the bac AMR samples of Clostridium and Enterococcus. A percent identity for BLASTp and Kalign as low as 38.13% and 46.19%, respectively, are needed to identify all the bac AMR sequences; however, these low percent identities lead to 6 and 3 of 14 false positives for BLASTp and Kalign, respectively, in which non-AMR sequences are miscategorized. Therefore, the low percent identities for BLASTp and Kalign required to identify all AMR sequences increase the number of false positives for a set of diverse AMR sequences. In Supplementary Table S2 we show that the performances of BLASTp and Kalign when identifying van AMR sequences are actually better than that of the GTDWFE algorithm. This is due to the very high similarity (>98.5% identity) between the training AMR and test AMR datasets for van. When training and test sets share high similarity, BLASTp and Kalign are guaranteed to give good results. However, as in the case of bac for which the training and test AMR data similarity ranges between 38.13% and 41.01%, BLASTp does not perform well. For Kalign, the similarity ranges between 46.19% and 49.17% so that it performs better than BLASTp. However, the GTDWFE algorithm will outperform both BLASTp and Kalign because it does not use sequence similarity but rather protein features for prediction. BLASTp and Kalign do not predict; they match sequence similarity.
<NbChars_0.5><LevSim_0.5>Discussion|In this work, we implemented a software package PARGT and extended our earlier work of identifying AMR genes in Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacteria. PARGT integrates the required software tools and scripts needed to generate all protein features automatically, and it performs predictions on user-inputted sequences. Moreover, users can update PARGT by including their own known AMR and non-AMR sequences to train the machine-learning model to potentially improve prediction accuracy. As our previous work described the experimental results for Gram-negative bacteria, in this paper we only included prediction results for Gram-positive bacteria. Simulation results showed that PARGT can predict AMR sequences for Gram-positive bacteria with accuracy ranging from 87% to 90%. PARGT gave better results for bac due to the diversity of sequences available, but BLASTp and Kalign exhibited better performance in the case of van because of the high similarity of sequences. To generate evolutionary and secondary structure features, we used the Uniprot database (containing 538,585 FASTA sequences) as our reference database for relatively fast execution; however, more accurate values for these features can be obtained using large-scale protein databases such as UniRef90 or UniRef100 (http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref) as target/reference databases. Note, however, that there is a trade-off between accuracy and computational time when using a large-scale reference database to generate features. A parallel version of PARGT would reduce the execution time of the tool for and ameliorate the use of large-scale reference databases.
<NbChars_0.2><LevSim_0.3>Methods|GTDWFE algorithm for feature selectionFeature collection, feature extraction, calculation of feature values, and feature selection using the GTDWFE algorithm are explained in detail in previous works21, 32. Briefly, a total of 621D candidate features were collected by means of a thorough literature search, where D stands for dimension (some features are single values, i.e., 1D, while others are vector values, e.g., 20D for the 20 different amino acids). We extracted all 621D features from both our positive (AMR) and negative (non-AMR) datasets and calculated their values. The GTDWFE algorithm was then used to select features for use in our machine-learning model. The GTDWFE selects the best feature at each iteration based on the relevance, non-redundancy, and interdependency values of all features. Initially, the weights of all features are the same i.e., 1. The relevance of a feature to the target class (AMR or non-AMR) and the distance of the feature to other features are calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and the Tanimoto coefficient, respectively. These calculations are performed for all features, and the feature with the highest summation of relevance and distance is chosen as the initial selected feature. The Banzhaf power index26 is then calculated to estimate the interdependency between the selected feature and the remaining features. We measure the contribution of each feature when it forms a group with other features, and the conditional mutual information is calculated to find the Banzhaf power index of the features. The weight of each remaining feature is updated by adding the product of the current weight and the Banzhaf power index to the feature selected previously. In other words, at each step, we readjust the weight of the remaining features dynamically based on the features selected in earlier steps. Thus, the weight of a candidate feature actually corresponds to the interdependence values with the earlier selected features. The feature with the highest summation of relevance and distance values multiplied by the revised weight is chosen as the next selected feature. This process is repeated until the desired number of features has been reached.Machine-learning algorithmAfter identifying the best feature subset for use with our classifier by means of the GTDWFE algorithm, we trained an SVM machine-learning model using this feature subset. This binary classifier was then used for prediction. As was true for our previous work, in PARGT we tuned the SVM using the training datasets and chose the best SVM model to predict the AMR proteins in the test sequences. We considered 10-fold cross validation to tune the SVM model. The SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and a cost value of 4 was identified as the best model for both bac and van training datasets. For the SVM, the RBF is used as a function in the kernel trick to implicitly transform the original space of the data to a high-dimensional space to make the data samples linearly separable, and the cost parameter is used to regulate the classification error.Figure 1The components of PARGT. Components outlined by dotted lines indicate additional training samples supplied by a user.Full size image Overview of PARGT softwarePARGT is an open-source software package designed and implemented for predicting antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria. PARGT is written using both Python 3 and R. R scripts were written to identify physicochemical and secondary structure features and for machine-learning modeling, and Python 3 was used to run the R scripts, to generate position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) features, and to implement the GUI. PARGT weight the importance of protein features based on their contributions during classification. All the required bioinformatics tools33,34,35,36,37,38,39 and scripts necessary to generate the protein features required in our machine-learning model are included in PARGT. PARGT uses the best feature subset identified by our GTDWFE algorithm to make predictions. It allows users to add new AMR and non-AMR sequences to the training datasets, and the software automatically updates the machine-learning model with the additional sequences, potentially resulting in an increase in the accuracy of the model. To minimize execution time, PARGT uses the UniProt database containing 538,585 protein sequences as a reference database, rather than a larger database, for generating PSSM and secondary structure features.Architecture of PARGTFigures 1 and 2 depict the architecture and GUI for PARGT, respectively. PARGT allows a user to input a set of known AMR and non-AMR sequences to use in the training dataset, generating all required feature values for these sequences automatically. As shown in Fig. 1, the 20D amino acid composition feature vector, 168D feature vector based on the composition, transition and distribution (CTD) model40, 41, 400D feature vector based on the PSSM, and 33D feature vector based on the secondary structure sequence and secondary structure probability matrix are generated from the input protein sequences. Then the best feature subset is constructed using our GTDWFE feature selection algorithm. An SVM is used as the machine-learning model that is trained using the selected feature set. Recall that the SVM model used for PARGT is automatically tuned during the training phase. Finally, the trained SVM model is applied to predict AMR sequences from the test dataset.As shown in Fig. 2, PARGT provides the option of predicting aac, bla, and dfr resistance genes for Gram-negative bacteria and bac and van resistance genes for Gram-positive bacteria. A user must select the appropriate option for predicting AMR from the GUI menu and also supply the test file for the set of protein sequences in FASTA format that they wish to have classified as AMR or non-AMR. PARGT automatically computes all the required feature values for the test sequences, and it provides an output file containing the set of predicted AMR sequences for the user’s test file. If a user wants to include new known AMR or non-AMR sequences to augment the training datasets, PARGT provides an option to do so for the five above-mentioned resistance classes. In addition, it provides the option of restoring the original training datasets in case a user decides they prefer to use them or or else wants to compare predictions using two different sets of training data.Figure 2Illustration of the PARGT GUI with its pop-up menu.Full size image DatasetsWe retrieved protein sequences for AMR genes from the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB)42, and non-AMR sequences were obtained from the PATRIC28, 29. Initially, we gathered 124 bac and 374 van AMR sequences for the Gram-positive bacteria Clostridium spp. and Enterococcus spp., and we randomly chose 52 essential protein sequences to use as non-AMR sequences. As many of the protein sequences were duplicates, CD-HIT43, 44 was applied to find unique sequences. A sequence identity of \(\ge \) 90% was used as a threshold for removing duplicate sequences. After eliminating redundant protein sequences, our final counts were 25 bac and 52 van AMR sequences; none of the 52 non-AMR sequences were duplicates. We used this dataset to train our machine-learning model. In addition to the training dataset, we also gathered 102 bac and 22 van AMR sequences and 14 non-AMR sequences for the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Listeria spp. from the data sources indicated above. We again applied CD-HIT to this dataset, and after the removal of duplicate sequences, 6 bac and 9 van AMR sequences and 14 non-AMR sequences remained. We used these as our test dataset to measure the accuracy of the classifier. The sequence identity of protein sequences could be as low as 10%. After validating our GTDWFE algorithm with the training and test sequences for the bac and van AMR classes, we again trained our classifier, but we used the sequences from all five bacterial genera, i.e., both training and test sequences, to potentially increase the accuracy of PARGT. The same retraining was also performed for our Gram-negative bacteria.
<NbChars_0.9><LevSim_0.6>Abstract|The density structure of the interstellar medium determines where stars form and release energy, momentum and heavy elements, driving galaxy evolution1,2,3,4. Density variations are seeded and amplified by gas motion, but the exact nature of this motion is unknown across spatial scales and galactic environments5. Although dense star-forming gas probably emerges from a combination of instabilities6,7, convergent flows8 and turbulence9, establishing the precise origin is challenging because it requires gas motion to be quantified over many orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Here we measure10,11,12 the motion of molecular gas in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxy NGC 4321, assembling observations that span a spatial dynamic range 10−1–103 pc. We detect ubiquitous velocity fluctuations across all spatial scales and galactic environments. Statistical analysis of these fluctuations indicates how star-forming gas is assembled. We discover oscillatory gas flows with wavelengths ranging from 0.3–400 pc. These flows are coupled to regularly spaced density enhancements that probably form via gravitational instabilities13,14. We also identify stochastic and scale-free velocity and density fluctuations, consistent with the structure generated in turbulent flows9. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the interstellar medium cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, its formation and evolution are controlled by nested, interdependent flows of matter covering many orders of magnitude in spatial scale.
