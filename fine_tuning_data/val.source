<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.5>3. Recommendations|Notwithstanding that some universities have responded to the public health emergency, universities should continue to develop courses of action and public health messaging to better address collegiate mental health issues caused by the disruptions of education and career trajectory. First, in addition to remote education, student advising should continue and transition to telecommunication (e.g., phone call, online meeting) in order to provide academic support for students. Faculty and staff should consider offering virtual office hours to students, and they need to work together to maintain the connection and help students process and address academic concerns caused by the disruption of the semester. Second, for students whose internships or research projects were affected by the pandemic, internship site supervisors and research advisors should actively engage in helping students seek alternative plans, enabling them to work from home to maximize internship and research experiences. Third, universities should work on innovative methods to support students to move research projects and capstones forward so that students can fulfil graduation requirements; meanwhile, university career centers should switch to virtue services, continuing to facilitate career development for college students.Of importance is that university counseling centers should set up options to continue to provide college students with counseling services at a distance (i.e., telemental health counseling) within the constraints of the pandemic outbreak. Telemental health has been found effective in treating anxiety and depressive symptoms (Brenes et al., 2015), and implementing telemental health will facilitate the delivery of counseling services to address students’ pressing mental health concerns (Dorsey and Topol, 2020). University counseling centers can also provide options for students to join online support groups that enable them to share common concerns and receive social support (Rollman et al., 2018). Further, university counseling centers and other departments should rally to develop and pass public health messaging onto students, sharing coping resources, and encouraging them to take action to protect their mental health.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.5>4. Conclusion|COVID-19 and its accompanying effects will continue impacting collegiate mental health and wellbeing profoundly; meanwhile, mental health serves a crucial role in combating the epidemic. It is thus imperative for universities to build awareness of students’ mental health needs and concerns, and to empower their students to seek help and support during this biological disaster. College students should tailor coping strategies to meet their specific needs and promote their psychological resilience. Considerable efforts made by universities should be dedicated to helping students thrive in this crisis. With the experience attained supporting students in this pandemic, universities will be well positioned to help college students stay well in mind, body, and spirit during other challenging times.
<NbChars_2.2><LevSim_0.5>Abstract|Many filamentous cyanobacteria grow as multicellular organisms that show a developmental pattern of single nitrogen-fixing heterocysts separated by approximately 10 vegetative cells. Overexpression of a 54-base-pair gene, patS, blocked heterocyst differentiation in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. A patS null mutant showed an increased frequency of heterocysts and an abnormal pattern. Expression of a patS-gfp reporter was localized in developing proheterocysts. The addition of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last five amino acids of PatS inhibited heterocyst development. PatS appears to control heterocyst pattern formation through intercellular signaling mechanisms.
<NbChars_0.8><LevSim_0.5>Abstract|Retrotransposition of processed mRNAs is a common source of novel sequence acquired during the evolution of genomes. Although the vast majority of retroposed gene copies, or retrogenes, rapidly accumulate debilitating mutations that disrupt the reading frame, a small percentage become new genes that encode functional proteins. By using a multibreed association analysis in the domestic dog, we demonstrate that expression of a recently acquired retrogene encoding fibroblast growth factor 4 (fgf4) is strongly associated with chondrodysplasia, a short-legged phenotype that defines at least 19 dog breeds including dachshund, corgi, and basset hound. These results illustrate the important role of a single evolutionary event in constraining and directing phenotypic diversity in the domestic dog.
<NbChars_3.0><LevSim_0.3>Methods|An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
<NbChars_0.2><LevSim_0.3>Challenges in treating COVID-19|Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which appeared in December 2019, presents a global challenge, particularly in the rapid increase of critically ill patients with pneumonia and absence of definitive treatment. To date, over 81,000 cases have been confirmed, with over 2700 deaths. The mortality appears to be around 2%; early published data indicate 25.9% with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required ICU admission and 20.1% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome [1].There is presently no vaccine or specific anti-viral drug regime used to treat critically ill patients. The management of patients mainly focuses on the provision of supportive care, e.g., oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid management. Combination treatment of low-dose systematic corticosteroids and anti-virals and atomization inhalation of interferon have been encouraged as part of critical COVID-19 management [2]. Other reported therapeutic agents that are used for the treatment of seriously ill patients have been noted in Table 1. Table 1Potential treatment options of COVID-19ClassesPotential treatment optionsReferenceAnti-viral> 85% of patients received anti-viral agents, including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h orally), ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 h intravenously), and lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg twice daily). Remdesivir is currently under trials at more than ten medical institutions in Wuhan and has been known to prevent MERS-CoV.[1]Anti-malarialAn old anti-malarial, chloroquine phosphate, has been effective in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia due to its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities.[3]Herbal treatmentsThere was widespread use of Traditional Chinese Medicine during the last SARS-COV outbreak and it is currently being used in China. The five most commonly used herbs were Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu), and Lonicerae Japonicae Flo.[4]Open in a separate window
<NbChars_0.2><LevSim_0.3>Convalescent plasma: one of the forgotten immunologically based strategies|Passive immunization has been successfully used to treat infectious diseases. A meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality and viral load in studies using convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections, including those caused by related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) [5]. Serious adverse events were not reported. Eighty SARS patients were treated with convalescent plasma during the last major outbreak. A significantly better outcome was obtained with earlier transfusion (before day 14), and no immediate adverse events were observed.A feasibility intervention study of convalescent plasma for MERS-CoV infection treatment failed to identify sufficient high-titer plasma from patients with confirmed/suspected MERS, their close family members, or healthcare workers exposed to MERS (n = 12 reactive ELISA/443 serum tested). Two fresh-frozen plasma units (250–350 mL/unit) would be required for each enrolled MERS patient ({"type":"clinical-trial","attrs":{"text":"NCT02190799","term_id":"NCT02190799"}}NCT02190799). Encouragingly, anti-MERS CoV titers measured by ELISA correlated with microneutralization (MN) assays [6].There are currently over 30,000 recovered COVID-19 patients, who could present a valuable resource of convalescent plasma for health care providers. China National Biotec Group Co has claimed that 10 seriously ill patients receiving this immunoglobulin therapy demonstrated improved oxygenation and reduced inflammation and viral load [7]. High-titer specific antibodies should be able to bind to SARS-CoV-2 and neutralize the viral particles, block access to uninfected cells, and activate potent effector mechanisms (e.g., complement activation and phagocytosis).
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.4>Conclusion|In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.
<NbChars_0.3><LevSim_0.4>Abstract|Background: Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day. Results: Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy. (Funded by Gilead Sciences.).
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.4>Abstract|The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.5>Abstract|This article introduces a new and unobtrusive wearable monitoring device based on electrodermal activity (EDA) to be used in health-related computing systems. This paper introduces the description of the wearable device capable of acquiring the EDA of a subject in order to detect his/her calm/distress condition from the acquired physiological signals. The lightweight wearable device is placed in the wrist of the subject to allow continuous physiological measurements. With the aim of validating the correct operation of the wearable EDA device, pictures from the International Affective Picture System are used in a control experiment involving fifty participants. The collected signals are processed, features are extracted and a statistical analysis is performed on the calm/distress condition classification. The results show that the wearable device solely based on EDA signal processing reports around 89% accuracy when distinguishing calm condition from distress condition.Keywords: wearable, electrodermal activity, arousal, valence, distress, calmness
<NbChars_0.2><LevSim_0.3>1. Introduction|Early mental stress detection can prevent many health problems related to distress (negative stress). Therefore, there is an urgent need to create new technologies to monitor the physical and mental health of people during their daily life. Fortunately, some efforts are being carried out towards monitoring and regulating people’s arousal state [1,2,3], which is indicative of stress or mental illness [4,5,6,7]. Thus, the lack of human–machine interfaces in interpreting the subjects’ emotional states is being faced with the important aim of understanding and managing personal well-being regarding mental health state.In this regard, a number of physiological features have been widely used in the literature [8,9]. These features use to measure alterations in the central nervous system [10,11,12]. One of these physiological markers corresponds to electrodermal activity (EDA). The utilization of EDA is excellent in assessing the arousal level, as it is able to quantify changes in the sympathetic nervous system. In order to continuously measure the EDA signal from the subjects, wearable sensors are the most appropriate in real mobility situations, given their performance in providing detailed user-specific information. Moreover, wearable sensors are greatly valued due to their light weight and their wireless communication capacities with either a computer or other wearable sensors [13].In this sense, there are several low-cost solutions for wearable long-term EDA monitoring. For instance, the similarity of signals between a prototype of the wearable Moodmetric EDA Ring is compared with a laboratory-grade skin conductance sensor in a psycho-physiological experiment [14]. Recently, a pilot study of EDA measurements conducted during a trade fair has been presented [15].This paper describes and assesses the performance of a new wearable electrodermal activity-based device in classifying distress or calm conditions. Section 2 introduces the hardware description of the wearable. Section 3 introduces an experiment that has been designed in order to assess the validity of the proposed wearable. The experimental design and the description of the study population are presented in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively. Then, in Section 4, the segmentation and processing of the several signals (Section 4.1), as well as the feature extraction process (see Section 4.2) and the statistical analysis of the classification capabilities (see Section 4.3), are described in extensive. Afterwards, the results are offered in Section 5, and Section 6 includes the most outstanding discussion and conclusions related to this work.
<NbChars_0.0><LevSim_0.1>4. Methodology|After the experimentation, all signals are segmented and processed according to the time duration of the stimuli. Next, the most significant time, morphological and frequency features are extracted. Finally, diverse statistical analysis and classification techniques are applied with the objective of maximizing the performance.4.1. Signal ProcessingThe EDA raw signals are acquired from the wearable at a sampling rate of 10 Hz and a 12-bit resolution. These specifications are chosen to remain the EDA shape unaltered and to prevent distortions [19]. EDA signals result from the superposition of two different components, SCR and SCL. The sympathetic nervous system fires the sudomotor nerve, provoking the phasic response. Traditionally, the SCR intensity has been quantified after each elicited stimulus by detecting peaks directly on the EDA signal [19]. Next, the difference between a found peak and its preceding local minimum is assessed.However, depending on the stimuli, it is frequent that SCRs appear as bursts, such that an EDA signal is represented as a sequence of consecutive SCRs. In this case, the SCR boundaries remain masked by the preceding response. Indeed, SCRs may occur at the rise or decay of existing stimuli, making it very difficult to determine if these responses correspond to a new stimulus or are part of previous events. In this regard, some works have defined different strategies for all possible overlapping cases [30]. Nevertheless, the through-to-peak standard method may result in an underestimation of the amplitude of consecutive SCRs, depending on the closeness among responses [31]. Recently, new studies have addressed this problem by decomposing the EDA signal into its two components by using a deconvolution operation [31]. Despite this approach requires more intensive signal processing, it has reported better performance than others that process directly the EDA raw data. Consequently, a similar methodology is applied in this work. Thus, considering the raw data from the wearable as y[n], a new 1.5 Hz cut-off low-pass FIR filter with order N = 32 is applied over this signal in order to decrease the possible noise produced in the different electronic stages. The resulting filtered signal y^[n] is calculated by means of a discrete convolution as:y^[n]=C0y[n]+C1y[n−1]+...+CNy[n−N]=∑i=0NCiy[n−i](3)Next, a deconvolution operation is carried out to separate SCR and SCL components. The deconvolution is an algorithm-based process used to reverse the effects of combining signals by finding the solution to the convolution equation, such that:y^[n]=(r×l)[n]=∑i=0Nr[n−i]l[i](4) being × the convolution operator in the time domain, y^[n] the filtered EDA signal, r[n] the required SCR and l[n] the SCL components. It is worth noting that l[n] corresponds to the transfer function in Equation (4), such that, if l[n] is known or estimated, a deterministic deconvolution could be used to compute the desired component r[n].In this regard, three different assumptions have been considered in this work. Firstly, the exact moments when the stimulus (picture) starts have been recorded as events, as can be observed in Figure 3b. Secondly, notice that the SCR component takes a while since the stimulus is fired until the sympathetic system reacts through filling the sweat glands, thus increasing the skin conductivity. Indeed, the exact time occurrence of SCR varies depending on skin type and genetic aspects [22]. Furthermore, the SCR duration varies subject to the stimulus’ nature and the participant’s reaction against such stimulus. Consequently, a fixed temporal window (5 s) is used as the time segment where the SCR response may occur, following the recommendations of a previous work [17]. Thus, a period from + 1 to + 6 s after the onset of each stimulus is considered. In third place, l[n] corresponds to y^[n] when no stimulus is elicited [19].Open in a separate windowFigure 3Different stages in EDA signal processing. (a) Raw EDA signal before filtering. (b) Raw EDA signal after low-pass filtering and stimuli onset. (c) Estimation of EDA baseline using a cubic spline approximation. (d) Skin conductivity response (SCR) obtained after the convolution process.Considering the aforementioned assumptions, the time intervals occurring before and after each phasic impulse are used to estimate the SCL gaps between the different phasic impulses. In this work, a cubic spline fit is used to approximate l[n] at the gaps produced in the SCR temporal window, as you may observe in Figure 3c. Once l[n] is known, r[n] can be computed by following the inverse process defined in Equation (4). Nevertheless, given the complexity of this operation in time, it is preferable to work in the frequency domain, where convolution and deconvolution become in simple multiplications and divisions. Thus, y^[n] and l[n] are transformed into the frequency domain by using the Fourier Fast Transforms (FFT), such that r[n] can be calculated as:r[n]F=y^[n]Fl[n]F(5) being y^[n]F, r[n]F and l[n]F the FFTs of EDA signal, and SCR and SCL components, respectively. The original r[n] component alone is estimated by computing the inverse Fourier transform over r[n]F. As it can be observed in Figure 3d, r[n] corresponds to a signal with zero baseline, where each impulse reflects the activation of the sudomotor nerve.4.2. Feature SetsIn the present section, all the features are estimated. The characteristics related to time domain, frequency domain, statistics and morphological analysis are computed for each physiological variable. In this work, thirty six features are used, as you may observe in Table 1.Table 1Temporal, morphological and frequency features computed for EDA signals.AnalysisFeaturesTemporalMSC, SDSC, MASC, MISC, DRSC, FMSC, FDSC, SMSC, SDSCMorphologicalALSC, INSC, APSC, RMSC, ILSC, ELSC, KUSC, SKSC, KUSC, MOSCFrequencyF1SC, F2SC, F3SCOpen in a separate windowDifferent time-domain and frequency-domain markers are computed over the phasic component SCR to characterize the EDA signal. The SCL tonic component is out of scope of this study, since it uses to vary among different people due to physical and genetic aspects [19]. Firstly, a number of temporal metrics are computed over the SCR component. Thus, the mean (MSC), standard deviation (SDSC), maximum (MASC), minimum (MISC) and the dynamic range (DRSC), defined as the difference between MASC and MISC, are estimated. In order to highlight the sudden changes in the skin conductivity, the first and second derivative of SCR are also computed. Then, the mean (FMSC) and standard deviation (FDSC) of the first derivative and the mean (SMSC) and standard deviation (SDSC) of the second derivative are calculated.In addition, several morphological features are defined for SCR characterization. Thus, in order to identify the morphological alterations produced when SCRs are present in the EDA signal, the arc length (ALSC) is computed as:ALSC=∑n=2N1+(r[n]−r[n−1])2.(6)This parameter discerns between the presence or absence of SCR components, and it has been used previously in the morphological characterization of Gaussian responses [32]. Moreover, some parameters related to the SCR amplitude are also used to assess the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Thus, the integral (INSC), normalized average power (APSC) and normalized root mean square (RMSC) of SCR are calculated as:INSC=∑n=1N|r[n]|,(7) APSC=1N∑n=1Nr[n]2,(8) RMSC=1N∑n=1Nr[n]2.(9)Furthermore, possible relationships between the amplitude and energy of the SCR signal with its arc length are studied. Thus, the area-perimeter (ILSC) and the energy-perimeter (ELSC) relationships are estimated as the ratio between INSC and RMSC with ALSC, respectively. Finally, high order skewness (SKSC) and kurtosis (KUSC) statistics, as well as the central moment (MOSC) are calculated on the SCR component. These metrics assess the symmetry and shape of a probability distribution, and can therefore be also considered as geometrical descriptors. Indeed, if an SCR is considered as a Gaussian distribution, SKSC indicates if the tail distribution is longer at the left or at the right relative to the normal distribution. Similarly, the SKSC shows the degree of peakedness or flatness of a distribution relative to the normal distribution.In regards to frequency aspects, the SCR component is transformed into the frequency domain by using a nonparametric FFT algorithm. Then, the spectral power in bandwidths 0.1 to 0.2 (F1SC), 0.2 to 0.3 (F2SC) and 0.3 to 0.4 (F3SC) Hz are estimated. These bands have been previously used in other studies [33].4.3. Statistical AnalysisShaphiro-Wilks and Levene tests have proved that the distributions are normal and homoscedastic for all the features studied. Consequently, the results are expressed in terms of the mean ± standard deviation for all the samples belonging to a same class. The statistical differences between both classes, calm and distress, are assessed by a one-way ANOVA test. A value of statistical significance ρ < 0.05 has been considered as significant.Moreover, a 10-fold stratified cross-validation is used to assess the discriminant ability of each feature. This kind of cross-validation allows to obtain a highly reliable performance generalization of the metric under study [34]. Indeed, this approach makes use of all available data both for training and testing. This avoids the possibility of the classification results to be highly dependent on the choice of a given training-test segmentation. Thus, the database is firstly partitioned into 10 equally sized folds, rearranging the data to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole. Then, 10 training and validation iterations are performed, such that a fold of the data is held out for test, whereas the other ones are used for learning within each iteration. For each learning set, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to obtain the optimal discriminant threshold between calm and distress condition. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive (TP) rate against the false positive (FP) rate at various threshold settings. Here, the TP rate (or sensitivity) is considered as the percentage of distress condition correctly classified. On the other hand, the FP rate (or one-specificity) corresponds to the rate of calm individuals improperly identified. The optimal threshold is selected as the value which provides the highest accuracy. Finally, the global precision is obtained by averaging this procedure 10 times.Additionally, the relationships among the different temporal, morphological and frequency features are analysed by means of decision trees. In brief, the algorithm starts taking into account all the input data, examining all the possible splits on each feature. Then, the split with the best optimization criterion, based on the Gini diversity index [35], is chosen. In this respect, the Gini index is commonly computed by using the Lorenz curve, and it is expressed mathematically as:G=aa+b(10) where G corresponds to the Gini index, a represents the area that lies between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve and b represents the area under the Lorenz curve. Thus, a node containing observations from just one group (pure node) has Gini index 0, while if the node contains observations from both groups (impure node), the Gini index is a positive number, ranging between 0 and 1. Finally, when the split has been executed, the aforementioned process is repeated recursively for the two child nodes using the remaining data. It is worth noting that some stopping rules are imposed to prevent tree overgrowth. Thus, the growth of every tree is always stopped when any node only contains samples from a group of subjects (pure node) or less than 20% of all samples.

In this respect, higher values of skin conductivity are observed in the distress class regarding the calm class for all temporal parameters. From a statistical point of view, all temporal parameters achieve a comparable power discrimination between both classes. On the other hand, a number of morphological markers are defined and used in this analysis. Most of them show an important discriminatory power. It is worth noting that ILSC achieves the most remarkable trends, while ALSC reports the lowest significance. Just like in the temporal parameters, the average values of the morphological markers show an increasing pattern, such that higher skin conductivities are observed in distress compared to calm condition. Regarding the frequency parameters, all the markers report a power increase when the subjects are elicited with stressing stimuli. In this regard, F2SC experiences the highest difference between the classes, achieving a considerable statistical significance.In order to estimate a reliable and robust classification accuracy for each studied parameter, the stratified 10-fold cross-validation is run five times. Thus, the average values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, reported by each marker and for both training and test subsets iterations, are shown in Table 3.Table 3Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and accuracy (Ac) for all the parameters under study and for training and test subsets.FeatureLearningTestAcronymSe (%)Sp (%)Ac (%)Se (%)Sp (%)Ac (%)MSC75.9583.1079.5269.0076.7872.95SDSC85.0678.9582.4378.5776.0777.38MASC81.4576.3578.9174.0772.2873.34DRSC82.9275.4279.1876.6471.0073.62FDSC74.5880.4377.5069.2174.8571.81ALSC72.1576.8674.5270.9275.6473.19APSC84.9879.8882.4379.9278.7179.28RMSC85.9278.9282.4281.5778.8579.94ILSC85.1279.7182.4281.7878.1479.99ELSC71.7873.1472.2563.0075.3569.16SKSC77.4481.0879.2973.2875.7174.53MOSC86.1978.7582.5075.2875.2175.18F1SC77.1577.9477.5774.8575.8575.38F2SC85.2985.9385.6184.9278.5081.61F3SC85.1279.7182.4280.3576.4278.30Open in a separate windowThe classification results are in agreement with the discriminatory power obtained previously.

Nevertheless, the energetic parameters APSC and RMSC show a very notable classification accuracy, reaching a correctness of 79.28% and 79.94%, respectively. In agreement with the discriminatory power shown before, the arc length (ALSC) achieves the worst performance in the classification. On the contrary, the area-perimeter marker ILSC reports the highest global accuracy among the morphological features, achieving a precision of 79.99%. Finally, frequency markers show a very notable performance, where F2SC reaches the highest global accuracy among all the studied parameters. It is important to remark that almost all markers show a good balance between sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, some remarkable parameters state a slight increase in sensibility, i.e. an increase in the ability of detecting distress condition. Hence, RMSC, ILSC, F2SC and F3SC report sensibility values higher than 80%.Considering this context, a series of tree-based classification models are programmed in order to study the possible relationships among the different parameters. Here we present the tree-based discriminant model that reaches the highest performance. This model is constructed by exclusively considering temporal and morphological features. In this case, the frequency parameters are excluded, thinking in a lighter algorithmic model only focused in analyzing the time domain. In this model, a threshold value of 4.4830 on SDSC parameter in this model serves to divide into two subgroups. Then, one of the subgroups is assessed by means of SKSC parameter, taking value 3.1102 as classification threshold. This tree-based model achieves a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 93.9%, 85.36% and 89.18%, respectively. In this regard, the model improves the global correctness more than 8%, regarding the performance of the best single parameter F2SC. It is also important to highlight that sensitivity, that is, the ability to discriminate distress condition, improves over 9%.
<NbChars_0.1><LevSim_0.2>6. Conclusions|A recent paper [36] says that “Stress is a very complex subject and measuring stress is not an easy task. There are many markers that could be used, many algorithms that could be applied, and many forms of stress which could be observed”. Moreover, an important number of works can be found in the literature based in distress detection. Although comparison among works should always be considered with caution, since different ways to provoke the stress may trigger several cognitive processes [22], it is worth noting that the present study has achieved a comparable performance to other systems aimed at classifying calm and distress emotional states. Thus, while this work has reported a global accuracy around 89% when classifying calm and distress condition, other works based on electrodermal activity as reported in very interesting reviews on wearable sensors for remote health monitoring [37,38,39], state stress detection rates ranging from 75% to 95% [40,41,42,43]. Nevertheless, complex classifiers have been used to improve their performance.For instance, an approach throws a precision of 75% using EDA after classifying with k-means, Gaussian mixture models, SVM and decision trees [44].On the other hand, it is important to highlight that these and/or other approaches have used an important number of features from more than one physiological sensor to calculate the stress degree. For instance, electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram and facial cameras complement EDA signals to reach an accuracy of 68% [45]. The classification is performed by means of support vector machines (SVM) and naive Bayes classifier. In another approach [46], heart rate variability (HRV) supplements EDA to obtain 78% of precision, also using SVM classifiers. Two other papers using EDA and HRV reach an accuracy of 97.3% [10] and 80% [47], respectively. However, in the first article [10] a driving task is analysed with a series of sensors: hand and foot EDA, together with three other physiological measurements, namely HRV, Trapezius muscle electromyography and respiration. Moreover, the other work [47] uses EDA, blood pressure, HRV, eye gaze and pupil dilation. Another work with three physiological measurements [48], which are HRV, skin temperature and EDA, gets a precision of 91.2%. In another work [49], a portable embedded device to measure the accumulated stress level is designed. This device uses EDA and HRV with electrocardiograph or photoplethysmograph signals to obtain an accurate stress level.On the contrary, our proposal uses only features from SRC to achieve a high performance that is comparable to the most remarkable works. In this sense, the most outstanding aspect of our contribution is the development of the necessary hardware, signal processing and classification model to deploy a wearable device with a high ability to discriminate between the two considered states. The simplicity of the classification model and the lightness of the signal processing approach enables this device to work in real-time and long-term. Another relevant aspect is that almost all the features computed on the SCR component show some degree of relevance in the classification.For the sake of comparability and reproducibility of the experiment described in this study, a DC-EXM method has been chosen for the acquisition of EDA signals. Indeed, most of the works using EDA, and found in scientific literature, have been performed by means of this methodology [19]. Although ESM approaches may provide some advantages over the EXM methods, as, for instance, no need of additional amplification and coupling circuitry, the output signal generated is biphasic or even triphasic, which difficult considerably the interpretation and further processing of the data [19]. From a point of view of electronic design, many efforts have been made to standardize the use of constant voltage versus constant current sources when using DC-EXM methodology. Despite constant voltage directly providing conductance values, there is no consensus in the literature about its generalized use, because the conductance value can be obtained easily with constant current sources if SCL is also measured. In this aspect, the design of constant current sources are preferred because they are easier to design and present less tolerance than constant voltage variants.Finally, some limitations should be considered. First of all, the wearable prototype has been tested in laboratory conditions enrolling exclusively young subjects. Therefore, the results of this work can not be generalized directly to the entire population. With the aim of validating the results obtained, people of all ages will be enrolled in future studies. Furthermore, a sequence of 10 consecutive pictures with lengths of 6 s have been used as stimuli in this work. Considering such duration for visualization, the cognitive dimension of exploration of images during the 6 s may affect the outcomes. In this line, there is no consensus about which type of stimulus (image, sound, or video clip) and duration is the most adequate to elicit certain emotional states [22]. Moreover, it should be noted that the same order of condition high arousal-low valence—low arousal-high valence could affect, which could suppose an experimental bias.
<NbChars_0.5><LevSim_0.4>Abstract|A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments that range in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.
<NbChars_0.3><LevSim_0.4>Discussion|We have described the patterns and signatures of structural variation in a large cohort of uniformly analysed cancer genomes. A major grouping of patterns in structural variants that emerges from our study is one in which extra copies of genomic templates are inserted during the rearrangement process. This includes simple events such as tandem duplications, as well as a range of more-complex events with duplications and triplications that are rearranged locally as well as inserted distantly. Our signature analysis grouped a large proportion of these more-complex events together with tandem duplications, which suggests that they represent a continuum of processes that share underlying properties. A replication-based mechanism has previously been proposed to explain local two-jumps4,23,24, in which stalled replication forks or other DNA lesions cause the DNA polymerase to switch templates and continue replication in a new location. Studies in experimental models are now revealing that a wide range of mechanisms and DNA lesions can result in templated insertions: these mechanisms include tandem duplications in BRCA1 deficiency10, translocations with templated insertions caused by dysregulated strand invasion38 and distant templated insertions in the absence of replication helicases39.Genomic instability in cancer is not a single phenomenon. Instead, many different mutational processes can act to restructure the genome and, in doing so, generate a notably flexible array of possible structures. Any given tumour draws on a subset of the available processes, shaped by the cell of origin, germline predisposition and other, unknown, factors: selection then does the rest, promoting the clone that has chanced on the structure that increases its potential for self-determination.
<NbChars_0.0><LevSim_0.1>Methods|No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.A detailed description of the methods used in this paper and many additional results are described in Supplementary Information. Here, we summarize the key aspects of the analysis.Generation of the structural-variant call setThe final set of structural variants used in this Article was generated by the Technical Working Group of the PCAWG Consortium and is described in the main PCAWG paper8. In brief, four variant callers were used to identify somatically acquired structural variants from matched tumour and germline whole genome sequencing data: SvABA (Broad pipeline), DELLY (DKFZ pipeline), BRASS (Sanger pipeline) and dRanger (Broad pipeline). These were merged into a final call set using a graph-based algorithm to identify overlapping breakpoint junctions across algorithms. Detailed visual inspection of structural-variant calls suggested that a simple approach of accepting all structural-variant calls made by two or more of the four algorithms gave the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.Structural-variant clustering and annotationTo identify clusters of structural variants, we developed a method for grouping structural variants into clusters and footprints to allow structural and mechanistic inferences to be made systematically. In parallel, we processed the somatic copy-number data and merged it with structural-variant junctions to enable us produce rearrangement patterns from the generated structural-variant clusters and footprints. We produced normalized representations of structural-variant cluster patterns, which enable us to tabulate the number of different cluster and footprint patterns and analyse their features. Finally, we performed manual and simulation-assisted interpretation of the recurrently observed cluster and footprint patterns. The individual steps of the structural-variant classification pipeline are outlined below and detailed in the subsequent subsections: (1) computing the exact breakpoint coordinates from clipped reads; (2) removing redundant ‘segment-bypassing’ structural variants; (3) merging rearrangement breakpoints with copy-number data to yield structural-variant breakpoint-demarcated, normalized, absolute copy-number data; (4) clustering individual structural variants into structural-variant clusters and footprints; (5) heuristically refining structural-variant clusters and footprints; (6) filtering artefactual fold-back-type structural variants with insufficient support; (7) determining balanced overlapping breakpoints (this step is to distinguish very short templated insertions from mutually overlapping balanced breakpoints); and (8) computing rearrangement patterns and categories.Distribution of structural variants across the genomeWe divided the hg19 human reference genome (autosomes and chromosome X) into 3,036,315 pixels of 1 kb, and calculated a suite of metrics per pixel to summarize a variety of genome properties with potential relevance to the distribution of rearrangements, as listed in the Supplementary Information. Properties were matched as closely as possible to the tissue of origin for cancer samples from the PCAWG data. All other genome properties were held fixed across all tissues. To test for associations between structural-variant event classes and the library of genome properties, the genome property metrics were compared between real structural-variant positions (randomly choosing one side of each breakpoint junction to reduce dependence between observations) and one million uniform random positions from the callable genome space. To compare the tissue-specific properties, each random position was assigned a random tissue type, drawing from the observed tissue-type distribution in the structural-variant call set. For each genome property and each event class, the real observations were pooled amongst the random ones, and then rank-transformed and normalized on a scale from 0 to 1. Under the null hypothesis of no event-versus-property association, the ranks of the real observations would follow a uniform distribution. We tested this in each case with a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test then applied a Benjamini–Yekutieli correction for false-discovery rate across the entire suite of tests and set the threshold for significance reporting at 0.01.Structural-variant-signature analysisWe used two algorithms for extracting structural-variant signatures. Both used the same input files, comprising a matrix of counts per patient (across all patients) of structural-variant clusters falling into a number of mutually exclusive categories. These categories included the major classes of structural variants, with the more-common events (deletions, tandem duplications and inversions) split by size and/or replication timing. The two algorithms that were used for extracting the signatures were (1) a hierarchical Dirichlet process and (2) non-negative matrix factorization. Further details on the implementation of these algorithms are available in the Supplementary Information.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.
<NbChars_0.4><LevSim_0.4>Abstract|Recent announcements indicated, without sharing any distinct published set of results, that the corticosteroid dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that "The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)].
<NbChars_0.8><LevSim_0.7>Abstract|In immigration enforcement, many undocumented immigrants with children are often detained and deported. But it is their US-born citizen-children that have been overlooked in immigration debates and enforcement policies and practices. Citizen-children are at risk for negative psychological outcomes when families are fractured and destabilized by arrest, detention, and deportation. The children risk being torn from their parents and, often, their undocumented siblings. To add to the small but growing empirical base on the effects of living under the threat of deportation and actual deportation of parents, we compared the psychological status of three groups of citizen-children: (1) a group living in Mexico with their deported parents; (2) a group in the US with parents affected by detention or deportation; and (3) a comparison group of citizen-children whose undocumented parents were not affected by detention or deportation. We compared children on self-report and parent-report measures of behavioral adjustment, depression, anxiety, and self-concept. Across the three groups we found elevated levels of distress, and differences between children who had experienced a parent's detention or deportation and those who had not. We discuss findings in the context of children's clinical needs, future research, and implications for immigration enforcement policy and practices.
