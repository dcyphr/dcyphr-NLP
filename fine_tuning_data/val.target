3. Recommendations|The transition to telecommunication is advised however faculty should consider offering virtual office hours. This will allow them to process the implications of the pandemic on their academic careers. Research advisors and internship managers should take an active role in reaching out to the affected students and working to figure out alternative options to maximize their potential experience in the program. Finally, universities need to work on novel methods to support students in their capstones and research projects so that students can achieve their graduation requirements.University counseling should set up telemental health counseling as it has been found to be effective in treating anxiety and depressive symptoms. They should also encourage students to reach out to support groups appropriate to the individual student and develop public health messaging to students and encourage them to take action for the safety of their own mental health.
4. Conclusion|It is vital that universities give students the option and encourage them to take their mental health into their own hands. To provide them resources, coping strategies, and psychological resilience. Universities are in a fantastic position to help college students stay well in both mind and body during this pandemic and their action is required.
Abstract|Many filament-like cyanobacteria have a repeating growth pattern of single heterocysts, or cells that specialize in nitrogen fixation, separated by 10 somatic cells. It was discovered that overexpressing a gene, patS, blocked the normal development of heterocysts. When patS was mutated to completely lose its function, there was an increased frequency of heterocysts and an abnormal pattern. When GFP was used as a reporter gene for patS (reporter gene fusion), fluorescence was strongest in somatic cells that were developing into heterocysts. Moreover, adding a synthetic peptide containing only the last five amino acids of PatS was sufficient to inhibit heterocyst development. PatS appears to control heterocyst pattern formation through intercellular signaling.BackgroundCell-cell communication plays a key role in controlling the development of different cells. Diazotrophs are cyanobacteria that do their own nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase, or the enzyme that breaks down nitrogen, loses its function when oxidized. However, many cyanobacteria produce energy from photosynthesis, from which oxygen is a byproduct. In diazotrophs, approximately every tenth somatic cell differentiates into a heterocyst, which effectively separates the two processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. PatS is a gene that mediates heterocyst expression. This experiment is done to effectively determine the effects of manipulating patS on heterocyst formation and pattern.
Abstract|The main focus of this paper is on retrogenes and transposons. Transposons are pieces of genetic material that can reinsert themselves back into the genome. Retrogenes are genes that can be created when these transposons are reinserted. While most retrogenes can cause detrimental mutations, there are a small number of retrogenes that can actually create functioning proteins. In this study, chondrodysplasia, a disease that causes some breeds of dogs to have shorter legs, is linked to a retrogene that encodes a growth factor, fgf4. This demonstrates how a single retrogene can drastically affect evolutionary development in the domestic dog.
Methods|The Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital was used as the data source for this study, as it was a designated treatment center for SARS-CoV-2 in the region. 52 critically ill patients (deemed “critical” based on ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or low inspired oxygen levels) admitted between Dec 24, 2019 and Jan 26, 2020 were observed. Age, sex, exposure history, chronic illness history, lab data, and various in-hospital symptoms (cough, fever, headache, chest pain…) were all collected and evaluated. Certain details such as ventilator settings could not be recorded due to the emergency nature of some provisional ICU’s. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality following a patient’s ICU admission, secondary outcomes were incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, fluid build up in alveoli) and the need for mechanical ventilation. Mean age of patients was 59.7, with 67 being men. 33 of patients had known exposure to the Huanan seafood market and 40 had known chronic illnesses.
Challenges in treating COVID-19|Coronavirus was first discovered in December 2019. The largest issue will be the rapid increase in critically ill patients. As of March 16th, there is no vaccine or drug available and current provisions focus on supportive care: oxygenation, ventilation, and fluid management. Currently, herbal treatments, anti-malarial, and anti-viral medications show potential promise as an effective treatment.
Convalescent plasma: one of the forgotten immunologically based strategies|Using plasma from recovered patients showed to cause a significant reduction in mortality and viral load. This was demonstrated with SARS-CoV and MERS-COV. No adverse side effects were noted. This therapy requires more research. New studies from China National Biotec Group Co have claimed similar reductions in viral load, inflammation, and symptoms after infusion of plasma.
Conclusion|No treatment plans are in place as of yet. It is too soon to see what will prove to have efficacy, but some preliminary results show promise, specifically the use of serum from recovered COVID-19 patients.
Abstract|Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog. Which means that its chemical structure imitates the chemical structure of a nucleotide. Nucleotides are how we store and transmit genetic information. SARS-CoV-2 uses this genetic language as well. To test Remdesivir it was given on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. A 9 day trial was conducted and the clinic data was collected for a one month period. This trial included severe cases of COVID-19 infection and compassionate-use of Remdesivir showed clinical improvements in 36 of the 53 patients (68). Measurement of its efficacy requires future randomized, placebo controlled trials.
Abstract|The virus that originated in China, SARS-CoV-2, that led to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) at the end of 2019 has spread to 28 countries/regions infecting a confirmed 43,000 people. The virus is spread between humans through direct contact or through droplets. The incubation period is 6.4 days and has a reproduction number of 2.24-3.58 (i.e. it is expected that one case will give rise to 2.24-3.58 cases). The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever followed by cough. The drug remdesivir showed promising results in a COVID-19 patient in the USA and is now undergoing clinical trials in China.
Abstract|This article introduces a novel unobtrusive wearable device that measures electrodermal activity (EDA) for health related systems. EDA measures the changes in conductivity in the skin because of increases or decreases in sweat gland activity. This device is placed on the wrist and continuously monitors if the user is in a calm or distress condition. The results indicate 89 accuracy when using only data from the EDA signal.
1. Introduction|The detection of stress can prevent many health issues related to distress. This warrants the need for a device to monitor and interpret a person's arousal state which would be beneficial for maintaining a person's emotional well being. EDA is directly related to the sympathetic nervous system, which works to cause arousal. Similarly, EDA sensors are cheap, small, and light weight which make it a prime candidate for implementation into a wearable. The best place for EDA sensors is the palms of hands or soles of the feet.
4. Methodology|Participants sit in front of a monitor with the wearable placed onto the wrist on the non-dominant hand. 10 neutral or emotionally charged images were shown in series to participants for 6 seconds with 1 second black screens in between. Before switching from emotional to non-emotional images, a 10 second black screen was shown to bring the participants to a neutral emotional state.
5. Results|Higher values of skin conductivity measured from EDA are observed during distress.
6. Conclusions|Other systems that measure stress use a variety of other physiological and camera sensors to reach an accuracy of 68. These systems achieve a worse outcome with more sensors. The researchers method uses only the measurement of EDA and is notable due to its small hardware size, signal processing capability, and software accuracy. However, this study is limited in several ways. There were only45 participants all of which were young, which reduces generalizability. Similarly, showing images within the same emotional category in series may affect the outcomes and could suppose an experimental bias. Finally, no other stimulus besides images was tested.
Abstract|Yilong et al. have developed a method to classify the variation of segments of the genome due to rearrangement of different segments. Method is based on sequencing data sourced from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium, comprising of 2,658 whole genome cancer samples across 38 tumour types. Sixteen signatures of structural variation have been identified. Deletions and translocation of genome segments occur with characteristic lengths and locations. A variety of genomic rearrangement processes contribute to the characteristic configurations found in cancer whole genome samples that can be influenced by further selection across successive generations.
Discussion|Patterns and signatures of structural variation of whole genome sequences from the PCAWG study have been described that include known variants. Both simple and complex events have been categorically described. A range of mutational processes contribute in variable combinations and intensities that lead to the observed signatures of structural variants. Experimental studies showed correlation between the range of processes and specific mutations, such as tandem duplications in BRCA1 deficiency (associated with breast cancer) and insertions in the absence of DNA replication helicase enzymes.
Methods|Whole genome sequences from 2,658 cancers of 38 tumour types were aligned to the human genome (reference hs37d5). Pipelines deconstructed genome sequences into catalogs of structural variants according to the proposed variant classification method.
Abstract|Recent news indicates that Dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. COVID-19 infection has been shown to cause multi organ disease caused by autoimmune degradation of the lungs. This lung damage is caused by uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines. In order for the body to best the infection, a coordinated attack from T and B cells is required. However, Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressant that would limit the damage from inflammation but inhibit the protective effect from B and T cells. It would prevent them from making antibodies and potentially lead to a greater viral load. Similarly, it inhibits the activity of macrophages. This drug may be helpful temporarily for severe patients, but continued use in recovery could inhibit the production of antibodies and be dangerous.
Abstract|Many undocumented immigrants with children are detained and deported in the United States. Their children are often overlooked in discussions about immigration and law enforcement. U.S-born children of undocumented parents, or citizen-children, are at risk for adverse psychological outcomes when their families are broken apart by detention and deportation. In this study, the researchers compared the psychological status of three categories of citizen-children: (1) those living in Mexico with their deported parents, (2) those in the U.S whose parents were detained or deported, and (3) those whose undocumented parents were not detained or deported, who served as a control group. The researchers compared these categories on measures of behavioral adjustment, depression, anxiety, and self-concept. They found all groups had elevated levels of distress, and differences between children whose parents experienced detention or deportation and those who did not. These findings are important for citizen-children’s clinical needs, and also for future research and immigration policy.
