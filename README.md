# dcyphr NLP playground 

## Main Idea
Fine-tune CNN-DM pretrained BART on dcyphr dataset of manually produced summaries of biomedical literature. Deploy model in production so that dcyphr users have access to automatic summarization and can reinforce the model by manually pruning the output.

## Todo
- Fine-tune pretrained BART on dcyphr data
- Discover alternative datasets for fine-tuning task
- Build out human in the loop pipeline
